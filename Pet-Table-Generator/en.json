The Western Front commander wishes to thank you from the bottom of his heart!","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_12":"Brog and his enraged boar were a real danger to everyone in the frontier.

I say that will never happen!","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_14":"Your quarry was fast, but you were faster! Now we have knowledge of every ambushes waiting for us in the Deadlands, and that's worth a lot! Here's your reward!","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_15":"So that's how it is!

Thank you for your work, Guardians!","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_16":"The Anthracite Knights are a special arm of Morth Chrone. How did you best them so easily? Duke Elirnille wishes to thank you for your invaluable service.","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_17":"The help arrived too late... Sol was already beyond saving. But his notes will help us fight the monsters. Thank you for answering our call, Guardians!","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_18":"Our garrison was no match for this monster, but you brought it down with ease, even if the fight took a while! We thank you!","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_19":"These are really wonderful sleepberries! The harvest this year will be plentiful.

Thank you for your work, Guardians!","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_21":"Although the monks claim they were saved by God, we all know who deserves the praise here. Thank you for your bravery!","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_22":"The rocks are on their way to Strongford! King Ingvar will decide what to do with them.

Diron's death will force the centaurs cease their aggression in our lands, for a time.","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_24":"At last we all can breathe a sigh of relief, knowing that Scrump's spies aren't watching our every step. Here's your reward, brave warriors!","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_25":"You have the gratitude of the whole of Riversar's Board of Academics! Now we know what to do against the mist, and people can once again go to the shores with no fear!","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_26":"A true example of fruitful cooperation!

The magical burden pressing on all of Riversar is finally gone!","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_28":"The rite has already begun. Your actions serve the Light, and neither gods nor men shall forget your deeds!","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_29":"Hardly anyone would call taming basilisks a fun pastime. Yet you managed to drive the beasts away and restore the purity of the sacred lake.","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_3":"That was not a simple task, yet you prevailed! Thanks to you, hope has returned to the hearts of men, and we shall work to bring their lives back on track.","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_30":"It shocks me that an enemy army so big managed to approach our capital completely undetected. This means there must be a traitor in our ranks! Thank you for your feats of valor, Guardians!","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_31":"We know how hard it is to decide the fate others. Yet justice must remain above all! You have made the right decision, Guardians!","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_32":"That was outstanding! You have passed the test with flying colors, and are worthy of praise!","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_33":"That was a daring and risky move, yet you have completed the quest. Mayhap you are the only ones who can stop the Darkness encroaching on your world!","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_34":"That voice! You could never forget it! The revelations spoken by the Warden made all quiver, as unto thunder amidst a clear day. The angels themselves echo those words and trust you all, Guardians!","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_35":"The fight took so long, even the angels themselves had little hope to see you alive! And yet, and yet! You have returned from hell itself, and that means you deserve to be the saviors of the Dominion!","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_36":"The epidemic is no longer a threat! You have our gratitude, Guardians. Strongford continues to prosper, all thanks to you!","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_37":"So it comes out, the thieves turned out to be a bunch of flunkies for the usurpers seeking to take the throne for themselves.

You have the gratitude of the Emperor himself, Guardians!","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_38":"We were within a hair's breadth of losing it all, but Cornelius, the beacon of science, has lived to see the new day. All thanks to you, Guardians! The whole of the Dominion is in your debt!","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_39":"Kdaeer Khani thank you heartily and wishes for you to take these well-deserved gifts. Oh, and he also asked me to tell you that all Guardians will be welcome at the Adjalar oasis, should you visit it.","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_4":"It was foolish to hope you would meet no foes on the way. But you have succeeded in your quest, and the Strongford University has gained new knowledge that will help us fight the Darkness!","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_40":"Hail to the gods! And to you, Guardians! Emperor Ingvar remains alive and well, thanks to your loyalty and service. Take this bravely earned reward!","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_41":"It appears that Vadjar found a winding road through the cliffs from the very heart of the blazing plains. The city would be an ocean of fire if you were not there! Thank you.","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_5":"That was an unspeakable battle, and yet you have prevailed, Guardians! Sylfide may have gotten away unscathed, but the children are back home now. The miller and his wife asked us to give you this, as a reward.","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_6":"How do you even do this? You managed to catch up with the garrison, spearheaded the attack and destroyed the evil without any losses. Truly a feat of valor worthy of the Guardians! The Emperor himself has sent you this reward!","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_7":"Did you see that? A whole camp full of snoring orcs! What a lovely sight. Our plan was successful, and every success comes with a reward!","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_8":"Ugh, it's as if the orcs write with their feet! Thank you for their writing samples, Guardians. They are on their way to be deciphered in the capital. Here's your reward!","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_9":"Who could have guessed that these lands concealed entire troll cities?!","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_BEFORE_1":"Food has become scarce in the forest areas, and starvation is looming over the land. And what's worse, Sylfide's lackeys in Wilheim further muddy the waters. We must deliver these provisions and keep the people from starving to death.","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_BEFORE_10":"Artemis is on her way to the capital with an urgent report, but the orcs have tracked her and are on their way to chase her down. We must collapse the Dilapidated Bridge on Hardan's Plateau, but only after Artemis crosses over to the other side. Then she'll be safe from her pursuers.","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_BEFORE_11":"Never before have so many fiends have stepped into the summoning circle! Even Gagaron himself has arrived to complete the ritual! This dark scheme must be disrupted by a sudden ambush and the death of the orc shamans' chieftain. We must hurry!","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_BEFORE_12":"Harun's army needs reinforcements! The battle on the southern plateau was going smoothly until Brog the Conqueror arrived on the battlefield.

Hurry to their side!","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_BEFORE_13":"The trade route through the Deadlands has been cut off. Caravans are being bombarded by ballistas.

Will you be overcome these obstacles?","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_BEFORE_14":"An Emissary of Darkness has been spotted on the route to the Gravehall Estate, the one that leads along the edge of the bottomless chasm. It will be no easy task to catch up with such a speedy foe and intercept the secret message he carries. Will you manage?","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_BEFORE_15":"It is known the Necropolis is inhabited by the living dead. In the past, their numbers stayed the same;\n yet now, new graves are appearing. What do they hold? We must infiltrate Necropolis and find out more about the inhabitants of the new graves.","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_BEFORE_16":"Time is short, so we must hurry! The daughter of lord Riversar, the duke of Elirneel, has been kidnapped by the anthracite knights while crossing the Tyrr. If they manage to bring her to Gravehall, she's as good as dead!","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_BEFORE_17":"Sol is our veteran spy. If he did not return to us at the designated time, then something terrible has happened. His last mission was to discover the weakness of Lich Guum, the new master of Gravehall. Sol must be rescued.","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_BEFORE_18":"Oh no, this is terrible news! Morth Chrone himself has arrived in the Deadlands. His very presence heralds the approach of something truly horrible! Guardians, you must hinder the schemes of the Darkness and leave the dragon without a single bone intact!","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_BEFORE_19":"Sometimes, even the forces of Light must resort to trickery. The sleepberries growing by the River of Oblivion are incredibly helpful for interrogations and acts of sabotage. But be careful: satyrs guard the berries.","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_BEFORE_2":"Zorakuul the Warlock has laid claim to the Glades of Silence. Anyone who meets his eyes is doomed to meet their death in mere hours. To put an end to this curse, you must separate the warlock from his greatest weapon: his eyes.","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_BEFORE_20":"The grass growing by the bogs of Wretched Marsh has strange properties: it grants immense strength when eaten, but turns the victim into an enraged beast. The centaurs from the Cadang thicket have made a habit of chewing the grass to turn themselves into mindless berserkers. Cut down the grass to keep their tempers in check.","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_BEFORE_21":"Ever since Markus left the Order's walls, the monks of St. Bran have enjoyed a long, quiet solitude. But today the monastery has been assaulted by the centaurs, and God only knows how long they will last on their own. Guardians! They need your aid!","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_BEFORE_22":"Heidi is a superb tracker. After a few days of scouting the area, he managed to find a hidden stash with Guardian soul stones! It was clear they were not hidden there with good intentions. Reach Heidi and help him escape the area with his haul.","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_BEFORE_23":"The centaurs have been attacking us more and more, their ferocity ever growing. Especially after Diron came to head the herd. We need a group of volunteers who would track down the centaur camp and put an end to their murderous leader. Will you aid us?","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_BEFORE_24":"Scrump was content to sit on his hands in Illwood for many years. But then, the Darkness arrived. Since then, he has created the biggest spy network, sprawling all across the Dominion.","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_BEFORE_25":"The people living in the suburbs of Riversar, once peaceful, have turned into aggressive monsters. Our scientists suggest the mist that has enveloped the eastern shore is to blame. We need to catch a few of these beasts to analyze them.","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_BEFORE_26":"Our spies managed to intercept Enigma's Chronicles. However, the notes are written in the language of the Darkness, and Kai is the only one who could decipher them. Riversar wishes to ask Kai to put old grudges behind us and aid in the decryption of the Chronicles.","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_BEFORE_27":"It's true the Elves are ever the realists, but few would ever see them truly despondent. Yet now the Elves all look gloomy and dejected. The hexers may be to blame here, and a few have been spotted on the shore.","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_BEFORE_28":"The annual rite in the Sanctuary of Temari cannot happen without Aurora. Our enemy knows about it, and will try to interfere with our plans at every chance. We must escort her to the sanctuary, and keep her safe and sound if possible.","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_BEFORE_29":"The fishing rite in the sacred lake turned into a tragedy: a group of basilisks, having gotten there from the cursed waters, have assaulted two fishermen. We must avenge the deaths of the innocent and put an end to the predators.","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_BEFORE_3":"Gar Taar was the only survivor of the attack on Octavia Manor by Sylfide's lackeys. He told us the attack was spearheaded by a head demon named Sora. You should be able to identify her easily by the two jagged steel blades she wields. That monster has to be put to an end!","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_BEFORE_30":"Can you hear the cannons roaring to the east? The monsters from the cursed waters have assaulted the Beacon: the pride of Riversar! The crystal is already beginning to show slight cracks: if we don't stop them, it'll be destroyed!","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_BEFORE_31":"Welcome, new heroes of the Dominion! Heaven knows all about your earthly feats of valor, but what are your souls truly capable of? In this trial of your Justice, you must judge the souls that linger on in Purgatory.","LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_BEFORE_32":"Do you like riddles? Do you enjoy risk? Then you will surely enjoy a trial by fair combat between the brightest minds. Show your mental strength and wisdom, Guardians.

What are you doing here?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1037":"Just chatting, is all. We're discussing the genie that lives here and the kindness of...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1038":"The genie?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1039":"Hey, Clobb! They want to steal our genie!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_104":"It's just that he doesn't appreciate the holiday spirit. We want to make him change his mind, but we're too shy to give him the gift.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1040":"Oh, not at all. We'd just urge you to be careful.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1041":"The genie isn't all that simple. She punishes careless travelers by granting their wishes!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1042":"What a load of claptrap! You just want to claim her before we do!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1043":"That's right! You want gold and weapons, just as we do. Surround them! We can't give them a chance to make a wish!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1044":"Stop it, you fools! Ugh, shame we can't avoid a fight...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1045":"Here's your proof! No one ever thinks of anyone else.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1046":"Still, I'll be honest and say that your faith in all that's good and just is worthy of respect.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1047":"We'll have this conversation later!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1048":"Deal! That \"later\" is coming pretty soon, though.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1049":"What can we do about what's going on?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_105":"Can we please give it to you, so you can pass it to him?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1050":"How do we stop these crowds of madmen blinded by their desires?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1051":"You're so caring, Yasmine. So honest.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1052":"Why are you telling me that?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1053":"It's just that you're too pure for your company.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1054":"You're trying your best going forward, but your partners are too jealous of you. They're the ones holding you back.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1055":"No! Stop that right now!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1056":"They underestimate you. They dislike you. They fear you!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1057":"Yes... You may be right. It's just like a curse. Feared by everyone...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1058":"Everyone except me. I'll help you find new true friends!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1059":"Your fellow travelers are your enemies. They've denounced you...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_106":"Well... Hypothetically, of course you can.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1060":"Enemies...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1061":"What are you talking about?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1062":"They're enemies! Go forth and take revenge, Yasmine!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1063":"There's no escape!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1064":"Yasmine, my dear, please stop. It's over.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1065":"What have I done?! How did I let this happen?!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1066":"It's alright, girl. We're here.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1067":"We're friends. We truly love and appreciate you.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1068":"She turned against you, and yet you forgave her?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1069":"I don't understand... No one does that, ever!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_107":"Here you are!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1070":"Forgiveness, trust and understanding. That's what a true friendship is built on!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1071":"I think Amira is starting to understand us. She's beginning to appreciate everything that is good and pure...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1072":"Agreed. I, too, can tell she's changed.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1073":"Ugh! I'm getting too old... You're fresh from the field, aren't you, little ones?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1074":"And here I am, uh... Trying to save the city from demons and evildoers of all sorts. Helping the local folks, you know.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1075":"You don't really look like a brave warrior, grandpa.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1076":"I believe it's time to introduce myself. I'm Shiba Lahm, a humble monster hunter.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1077":"I've been trying to hunt down the genie that lives in this desert for a very long time. Thank you for helping me locate her trail.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1078":"Amira is incredibly dangerous. She must pay for her wicked acts. She...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1079":"Hold on. We never told you her name, and she rarely reveals it to strangers... How did you learn it?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_108":"Hahaha! That certain someone is actually you, Isaac! Happy Winterfest! Remember, holiday magic is real!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1080":"Easy. He's been spying on us the whole time. What he said was an outrageous lie!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1081":"I think I remember now. Shiba Lahm, a highwayman and a thief, the terror of the Adjalar Desert.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1082":"He's the embodiment of evil, selfishness, and greed. Shiba Lahm will sacrifice anything for wealth!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1083":"I don't...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1084":"You were the one who separated me from my family forever!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1085":"You showed no mercy, spared no one. The goddess saved me that night. Me alone... And at what cost?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1086":"Ah! So you did survive that night. It's a shame, that.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1087":"I'll seek revenge. Justice will be served!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1088":"Not this time, my dear! You're an even match, and I'm not one to take risks.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1089":"You'll get to face my friendly minions instead. Have at them!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_109":"These people sure are weird. Send me an invitation, and then never show up...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1090":"Where did he go? Heavens, curse that scoundrel!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1091":"We need to take a minute and figure everything out.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1092":"What's there to think about? We must go ahead and act!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1093":"I fear that won't work out well for us...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1094":"Ziri, wait. Let's take a moment and rest. Yasmine and you don't have it as hard as me in the desert...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1095":"Are you kidding me? The hot sand is hurting my poor little tail...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1096":"Ziri, don't rush!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1097":"I must catch him! Make him pay for all he's done!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1098":"He...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1099":"Hold on. Shiba Lahm's tracks go cold at the entrance of this strange cavern.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_11":"We did it, Artemis! Let me hug you, my darling!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_110":"And those who didn't invite me are eager to talk for some reason.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1100":"Hah! If fairytales are anything to go by, these caverns are where genies live.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1101":"Did one of your tight-knit trio mention genies? It's about time!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1102":"No, I just said...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1103":"Not you! I can feel your pain, hear your call... What do you wish for, Ziri?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1104":"I seek to avenge my innocent family!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1105":"It's a dangerous path you're choosing. Oh well, all the better. I'll grant your wish and teleport Shiba Lahm right here.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1106":"But... I feel like you're an honest, sincere group of friends. It's thanks to you that I've begun to change and believe in all that's good.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1107":"Please make the right decision once more!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1108":"Hold on, Ziri! What did you wish for? Vengeance won't make your family come back! Don't grant that wish, Amira!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1109":"I think it's too late now... Look who's here!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_111":"Holiday season? That's when you can eat all you want! I'm Rufus!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1110":"No! I refuse to take revenge. This is my final choice.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1111":"Vengeance won't reunite me with my family. All it'll do is unleash more evil.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1112":"Well done, Ziri.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1113":"You did the right thing, Ziri!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1114":"This evildoer must be tried in accordance with Adjalaran law.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1115":"Amira, could you help us bring this criminal to the city and hand him over to the guards?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1116":"Have no doubt, Ziri. I'll do it right away.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1117":"I must also say I admire you for making that decision. It has...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1118":"Awoken something new within me. I've never seen or experienced kindness in the thousands of years I spent in this cavern. In this lamp.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1119":"The lamp?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_112":"You misheard me, Mr. Rufus. I'm talking about my neighbors here in this inn.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1120":"...Tempting those weak in spirit was quite fun...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1121":"But it's different now. I can tell you're walking the path of dignity and honor.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1122":"Now I believe this. From this moment on, I'm walking this path too!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1123":"Elmir, Ziri! I have an idea.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1124":"Dearest Amira, do you think you could possibly grant us one more wish?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1125":"There's no doubt you deserve it. Just say the word!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1126":"We want you to no longer be a slave to your lamp.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1127":"Join the ranks of the Guardians and make the world a better place!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1128":"I'm not a slave to my lamp, my dear friends. Never have been, in fact.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1129":"Still, I'm touched by the thought. And the invitation to join the Guardians, too!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_113":"You gotta love your neighbors! There's this one story I could tell you... It happened right on Winterfest Eve!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1130":"I gladly accept!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1131":"Yay!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1132":"*whines*","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1133":"Hush, Fenris! There's no need to rush.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1134":"There, there, boy... We're on our way.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1135":"I know I don't look the part, but I'm not feeling too good either. Like a cat in a rocking-chair factory...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1136":"You shouldn't have left Merlin home alone! Ha ha!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1137":"Now this is odd... The ritual circle has been activated...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1138":"*whines*","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1139":"Huh. What's so special about it?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_114":"Ugh, not another one...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1140":"Several decades have passed since these wicked fires were last ignited, that's what!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1141":"Look!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1142":"You're alive! There's light within you!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1143":"You can still help my brothers and sisters!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1144":"Lookie here, Shana!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1145":"Here we are, keeping watch over the master's altars, and this 'ere crowd is bothering us!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1146":"That ghost sure is talkative... We'll make 'im shut up for good!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1147":"Yeah, along with the rest of 'em!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1148":"The Thorn Arches stood desolate for ages, until a new master arrived. Tyrod. A greedy sorcerer filled with envy...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1149":"He's conducting dreadful experiments on my raven kin!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_115":"See, when I was just a wee lad, I figured I'd go steal some apples from our neighbor.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1150":"Ritual circles, and the rituals themselves...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1151":"Indeed, that's him.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1152":"Now I see whose dark aura is disturbing Fenris.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1153":"*whines*","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1154":"I am but a ghost with no flesh, but you can help me.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1155":"The Thorn Arches are overcome with ravens, both fallen and living...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1156":"One of them can resist the dark sorcerer's will.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1157":"Khorus is his name.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1158":"My soul, along with those of my fallen kin, can help Khorus purge evil from the lands of Chaos.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1159":"Follow the ghost raven! I sense our help will be needed!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_116":"I sure hope this is where the story ends.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1160":"Hordus avero...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1161":"Xard magistrus...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1162":"Stop mumbling to yourself, Phobos. We can hear it too.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1163":"It's not me. Look at the clearing over there.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1164":"Magistro kow masta. Avero!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1165":"Fiere uno magistro!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1166":"Those are Tyrod's priests. Please don't let them complete the ritual!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1167":"If they do, yet another raven will succumb to the mage's wicked spells...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1168":"They're doomed to fail, you can be sure of that!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1169":"The ritual was stopped! Which means one of my brothers survived!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_117":"Nah, wait. So, I gathered a bag full of apples and hightailed it out of the orchard. But the neighbor was faster! He caught me and spanked me so hard I couldn't sit still for a week.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1170":"I wish I could say the same about myself.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1171":"What about the raven you mentioned before?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1172":"Khorus? He's a fighter, that one. But even he couldn't do it alone.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1173":"Khorus has become a legend, no less. He possesses an unbelievable magical power and wisdom.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1174":"How \"unbelievable\" are we talking here?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1175":"So much that his talent and skill brought a dark sorcerer to these lands.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1176":"So much that the sorcerer got angry and took to conducting inhumane experiments on other birds...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1177":"We absolutely must help him!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1178":"My poor friends, all of you... You didn't live to see joyful days of freedom once more.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1179":"Yet I keep fighting. I call upon your souls to aid me!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_118":"Well, it was your own fault, after all.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1180":"Lead us forth, friend...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1181":"We grant our souls to you, Khorus!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1182":"So you're Khorus? We need to...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1183":"Who are you? More torturers that wish to become masters?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1184":"Or haughty buffoons that are about to become prey?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1185":"Begone!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1186":"They want to take Master's bird. Give the bird back!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1187":"We don't have any birds! Get lost!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1188":"Give the bird back, I tell you! Or else we're putting you to sleep!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1189":"Right in the graveyard, we are!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_119":"True. Listen on!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1190":"Oh well...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1191":"That was him! That was him!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1192":"Can you believe it?!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1193":"What is it? Another experiment? Or did the sorcerer let him out for a walk?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1194":"What is it?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1195":"Please calm down already.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1196":"There's no calming down! He summoned the dead ravens to aid him!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1197":"So why are you still here, huh?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1198":"Uh... He disappeared so fast. I didn't have time to...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1199":"Ugh, just admit you're a birdbrain!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_12":"Pfft. Let's go already!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_120":"And then, on Winterfest, that neighbor came over with a huge apple pie made of those apples! I thought he'd tell Father everything then and there.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1200":"I will find him and try to save him, alongside you or on my own!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1201":"There, there. Don't be angry!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1202":"Look at me, friend. You must know I'm no stranger to the raven brotherhood.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1203":"And I won't stand idle where others are imprisoned!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1204":"We'll help you. Count on us.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1205":"The castle is just ahead. The mage must be close!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1206":"Close! Close!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1207":"Is he speaking or... cawing?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1208":"Close! But you can't reach him.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1209":"They want to take my Master from me! My Master is mine, and mine alone!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_121":"But he just put the pie on the table and said Winterfest was the time of forgiveness and tasty treats.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1210":"I'm his loyal and faithful raven! I'm better than the others! So obedient! So smart!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1211":"Oh gods... You're just pathetic!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1212":"Just let us through, friend. We'll release your brothers.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1213":"You'll come to your senses and realize you've been tricked! Bewitched!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1214":"No! Not at all! I'm useful. And angry when someone badmouths my Master!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1215":"You promised you'd help me, Master... Only to abandon me when I needed you...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1216":"Yet another raven, corrupted and broken... But it's not the one I told you about.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1217":"Tyrod the mage is a tyrant who was once a friend to Khorus.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1218":"Tyrod wasn't always like that. The mage and the raven were lifelong friends, helping each other master the arcane arts.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1219":"They were friends? What happened?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_122":"Sounds like your neighbor doesn't hold grudges.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1220":"Tyrod's pride got the better of him. He concluded that Khorus owed his wisdom to him.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1221":"His lust for power was insatiable. No one, not even his dearest friend, could cross him!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1222":"Abandoning a lifelong friendship... That's not right.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1223":"*whines*","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1224":"Ugh... That's a very long story.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1225":"The Thorn Arches! They used to look different...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1226":"Right. All these cages, feeders, feathers...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1227":"Brothers and sisters!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1228":"I come with those who can save you and the legendary Khorus!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1229":"Tyrod is out there, in the depths of the Thorn Arches...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_123":"He's a wonderful man! Taught me a good thing, that one. So I want to pass it on. Here, take this gift and remember: Winterfest is the real deal!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1230":"The great Khorus needs help... Go forth!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1231":"Shoo, immaterial creatures! There will be no 'forth'!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1232":"You're no match for Tyrod, and you will not reach him.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1233":"Your journey ends here... uh... with a sudden death. Yeah, that's about right!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1234":"Does it now?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1235":"So, regarding the friendship between the mage and the raven...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1236":"They lived as friends, equal in everything, as Khorus studied the arcane and other arts.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1237":"The sorcerer taught his feathered friend a lot, and learned just as much from him.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1238":"What could go wrong, you'd ask...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1239":"True. Yet Tyrod ended up envying the raven. Can you fathom this?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_124":"The engineers haven't shown up. Is it normal to invite someone over and then be late to meet them?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1240":"Envying his friend? That's absurd!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1241":"*whines*","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1242":"So imprudent and careless of him!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1243":"*growls*","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1244":"Please, do let me proceed with their story!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1245":"Tyrod resolved to find the secret to Khorus' power, all while drawing in the magic of the Thorn Arches.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1246":"Khorus could tell what was happening with the sorcerer...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1247":"Oh...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1248":"...But he refused to believe his dearest friend could take such an awful turn.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1249":"So I'm all like, you wanna pin it on me, rookie?!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_125":"You must feel hurt and insulted. Isn't that right, boy?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1250":"And he's all like, I'll show you, Tyrod's guards...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1251":"Tilda! Look who's here!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1252":"Just passing through. Please don't mind us.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1253":"Yeah, right!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1254":"Just let me beat up these horrid vagabonds, brother, and I'll finish telling my story!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1255":"Hey! Over here!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1256":"Tyrod decided to make the Thorn Arches his new home because of their ritual circles. He lusted for power.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1257":"And the raven?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1258":"Khorus could see his friend was changing for the worse. At first, he tried to understand and offer support...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1259":"...Later, he tried to stop him.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_126":"Don't sneak up on me like that! That was scary!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1260":"But it was too late.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1261":"*growls*","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1262":"Lust for superiority clouded Tyrod's mind. He shackled Khorus and began torturing him for knowledge.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1263":"Betrayal!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1264":"Moreover, Tyrod started to imprison any ravens that got caught in his clever traps.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1265":"Yet none of them could match Khorus' skill.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1266":"Meanwhile, Khorus silently endured cruel experiments and torture.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1267":"His former best friend's betrayal weighed on him the most. Still, he never gave up.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1268":"The throne room! An arrogant bastard such as Tyrod just has to reside here!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1269":"There he is! He's keeping Khorus on a leash!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_127":"That's just how I am, my sweet boy. I scare others... and never forgive!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1270":"Charge forth!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1271":"That won't do. Those who desire an audience with the great mage must meet me first!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1272":"Who are you?!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1273":"I'm Tyrod's Echo! The voice of the great, invincible sorcerer!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1274":"The Dominion knows no mages more powerful than Tyrod!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1275":"Ugh... He just keeps singing Tyrod's praises!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1276":"No other mage could match Tyrod's genius, especially not a pathetic raven!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1277":"Do you mean Khorus?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1278":"Halt!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1279":"You stupid, arrogant fools...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_128":"Actually, I forgave someone just once and decided not to kill him. It happened on Winterfest Eve.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1280":"How dare you imprison these birds, Tyrod!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1281":"None shall encroach upon Tyrod's greatness!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1282":"No human, elf, nor orc! And least of all, no lousy raven-scum!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1283":"...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1284":"I'm the wisest, the most brilliant, the most powerful mage in this world!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1285":"But your best friend...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1286":"Silence!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1287":"I depend on no one, and none will best me! Friendship is a weakness!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1288":"Blah blah... A madman's ramblings know no end.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1289":"?????","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_129":"Are you quite...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1290":"I've heard all that and nothing else from Tyrod for years, all while trapped in a cage.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1291":"But... but you're free now!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1292":"Have been for several years, in fact.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1293":"I chose not to flee. I clung to the hope that my former friend would eventually see reason...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1294":"...To no avail. Others began suffering, too.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1295":"How dreadful!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1296":"I was forced to make a difficult choice. And that I did.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1297":"Tyrod is no more!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1298":"No more control, no more dungeons or cages...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1299":"From now on, I vow to be a savior to those deprived of their freedom...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_13":"Mojo the Guardian has been captured by orcs, and this tower blocks the only path to Hardan's Plateau.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_130":"Huh?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1300":"...And a nightmare of those who attempt to claim it!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1301":"Freedom to the raven brotherhood! Freedom to one and all!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1302":"*joyful*","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1303":"Hurray!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1304":"Finally! We're here. It's been a long road, but I'm hardly even tired.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1305":"Which way do we go now?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1306":"Are we sure this is the place?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1307":"Let's peek over the fence!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1308":"I don't see an entrance around here, so we don't have a choice, do we.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1309":"That's the worst idea ever. We're definitely getting caught...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_131":"Er... please go on. I'm listening carefully.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1310":"Hey, you robed vagabonds! What brings you here? This is no place for you!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1311":"Guards!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1312":"When people die, all arguments about who is right and who is wrong become void.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1313":"Alright, easy now! I can tell you're no buffoons.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1314":"Who are you, then? What seek you at the Edge of the World? And why break in?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1315":"We're brave warriors! Heroes of the Dominion! We want to grow stronger!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1316":"And wiser... Preferably all at once.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1317":"Please forgive the insolence of my companions. We're from the Dominion, that is true. We're traveling around places of power, and rumors brought us here.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1318":"So you're seeking answers to the questions of the Universe?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1319":"You could say that.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_132":"It happened on Hardan's Plateau, right in the middle of the orc camp. Their chief, Gro Bulgor, was my target.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1320":"In that case, you've come to the right place. However, the right to enter is reserved for the Chosen Ones. You'll have to earn it.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1321":"What do we need to do? I'm prepared to fight anytime!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1322":"Hush, tough guy...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1323":"Fighting is all he cares about.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1324":"Get some proper rest, travelers. You'll learn more tomorrow.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1325":"Oh, the newcomers. Did you sleep well?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1326":"We've spent a whole day and night here... But I don't feel any newfound strength yet!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1327":"Patience. First, I'm going to introduce you to my best warrior.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1328":"Do you want us to make small talk while we enjoy a cup of tea together, too?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1329":"I'm afraid he's not much of a talker. He swore a vow of silence in exchange for great power.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_133":"His minions were easy to kill, but also evil and smelly.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1330":"I think I know how this works. We'll have to sacrifice something to get all the answers, is that right?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1331":"It's even better than that! Yesterday, you earned your right to enter. To stay, you'll have to fight him and prove you're truly worthy!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1332":"You could say that.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1333":"Now that's what I like to hear!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1334":"Looks like we might have been tricked...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1335":"Thank you, warrior! You may return to your duty. We shall not disturb you again.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1336":"So we're the Chosen Ones?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1337":"Will there be a formal welcome? Personally, I'd love to relax in the hot springs.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1338":"Are we getting armor and weapons that sturdy?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1339":"Silence. I don't think it's that simple...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_134":"Except for one. A young orc, so scared he wet his pants. He just stood there, looking at me in fear. So annoying!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1340":"I noticed your special abilities in battle. The sage might appreciate having you by his side.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1341":"The sage?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1342":"You've met him before... He's the most esteemed man at the Edge of the World.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1343":"Oh, there he is, coming to greet you. Make sure to be polite.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1344":"Experience is something you gain when you fail to gain what you sought.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1345":"I hate riddles.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1346":"Don't let his peculiar speech bother you.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1347":"The sage means you have to carry on despite failures. Some things can only be understood through effort.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1348":"Was that a sermon just now?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1349":"You're perceptive. Three trials await you. Only the Chosen Ones can pass them.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_135":"But I didn't kill him. D'you want to know why?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1350":"So we won't be bathing in the hot springs anytime soon...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1351":"You might have proved skilled warriors yesterday, heroes, but your adversary is too powerful to be bested by ordinary methods.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1352":"You'll have to work as a team, prove you're using your skills to make the world a better place, and show that your intentions are pure.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1353":"Where's the adversary? Those kinds of trials are just my thing!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1354":"Don't rush. The trials come first, the battle with true evil comes later.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1355":"An adversary... True evil... I thought we'd solve some riddles or something.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1356":"Give me those trials! We can take care of them real quick, guys!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1357":"I'm here!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1358":"Hey, tough guy? This one's yours.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1359":"Are you going to fight alone? Won't you call your friends?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_136":"Because Winterfest is a special holiday. You're supposed to give gifts to others.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1360":"I don't need nobody to bring you down. I'll just beat you up myself!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1361":"If you don't believe in your friends, steer clear of battle, or you'll lose.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1362":"Believing in someone makes you rely on them... It only makes us weaker.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1363":"You look strong enough. What do you need these two for? I bet you're just afraid of everyone, even your own sword!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1364":"He who is not afraid of his sword has no right to wield it.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1365":"You passed the first trial, proving that you can work as a team.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1366":"His defeat was inevitable. One warrior doesn't make a battle.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1367":"I don't know, I think it was fun. Actually, we might hit it off! No one else likes me, for some reason.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1368":"Actually, I didn't like you at first either.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1369":"But you were just standing there doing nothing...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_137":"Don't you want me to give you a gift too?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1370":"The tough guy here and I are the Chosen Ones, no doubt about that. I'm not too sure about you, though.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1371":"The fox is right. We've been traveling together for a while, but we still don't know anything about your abilities.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1372":"You talk too much.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1373":"Ah, youth... There's still work to do.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1374":"Which one of you is the most cunning one, travelers?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1375":"It depends on why you're asking...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1376":"Hey, fox! That's you! Here's our trickster!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1377":"Sold his buddy right out, just like that...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1378":"Don't worry. He seems weak enough. I'll take care of him.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1379":"Don't expect an easy victory. I've poured all my knowledge into this project. You can't defeat Tes'Lin!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_138":"Er... No, thanks. I'm good...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1380":"If you lose, I'm calling you a nerd from that moment on.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1381":"Enough chattering. Draw your weapon! Or are you hoping to blow away my baby with your fan?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1382":"You're doing it wrong. The wisdom of the east dictates that if you want to seem more powerful, hide your weapon.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1383":"You're cunning! Will you keep on scheming, or should we begin?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1384":"Why would I need to keep scheming? My schemes are already complete. I just need to pull the right strings at the right moments.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1385":"That was the second trial. Evil is cunning, so it must be countered with unexpected methods. Well done! You did great.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1386":"I can trick a dozen contraptions a day.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1387":"Told you, that's one cunning fox!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1388":"You and I really shouldn't expect an easy death...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1389":"So, what's next? There's still one more trial to be had.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_139":"Hahaha! Don't worry, I'm generous today!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1390":"It's our taciturn friend's turn...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1391":"I'm ready.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1392":"Your trial is Qing Mao!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1393":"Hmm... There's this one spell...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1394":"\"Cast away your worries for a moment and take a look... The real world has transformed!\"","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1395":"We aren't going to fight these kittens, are we?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1396":"Reality distortion? That's a rare skill to have! Good think we're no mere pets. It's easy for us to adapt to the unexpected.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1397":"Hey, chill! I just accidentally said the truth, that's all!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1398":"Be careful in battle. With my ability, everything isn't what it seems.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1399":"Kill me!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_14":"There are no doors to be seen, but maybe I just need a closer look...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_140":"I'm starting to resent this massive waste of time.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1400":"No.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1401":"Why?!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1402":"Those who would kick a kitten when it's down are pathetic. If I must become pathetic to survive... I'll be as good as dead.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1403":"Great job, heroes! You passed the last trial and showed your compassion. Now, do come upstairs...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1404":"My spell will last just long enough to conjure a stairway to heaven for us.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1405":"Hey, that's cool!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1406":"You should have said something sooner! We could have skipped walking all the way here!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1407":"I have found those worthy to battle alongside you, wise sage. You should test their mettle yourself.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1408":"Dreams of the past are meant for old men.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1409":"Are you toying with us? Is your sage actually evil?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_141":"Why so gloomy? Missing your holiday costume, just like me?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1410":"Play is what really matters. One can always work some other time.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1411":"What is he blabbering about?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1412":"I will answer all your questions and explain, heroes. But first, you must pass the last trial.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1413":"So this isn't the final battle?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1414":"I will fight you with words, rather than with weapons.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1415":"The only thing more admirable than a worthy victory is a worthy defeat.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1416":"You made it! Now I can recount the sage's tragic story for you.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1417":"In days of yore, a young warrior overestimated his strength and challenged the Embodiment of Vices to a duel.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1418":"Their powers were unequal at first, but the warrior tried his best and kept on improving. The battle continued on and on, with no end in sight.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1419":"The warrior was getting stronger and wiser, but his adversary's power grew alongside his own.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_142":"No, thanks! I don't need any costumes! I'll have you know I don't care for holidays.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1420":"Over time, the warrior's brow was covered in lines and his body shriveled. No longer a young man, he grew weaker and more frail by the day.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1421":"In the end, he was defeated. His mind was devoured by his adversary, but his wisdom remained, becoming his new power to wield.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1422":"The first defeat did not break the Sage, and he charged into battle once more.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1423":"The battle of the sage and the Embodiment of Vices lasts to this day, resembling an endless game of chess, if anything.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1424":"To turn the tide of battle, the Chosen Ones must appear on the chessboard.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1425":"Courage and stupidity. That explains it.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1426":"The mind exists for those who cannot live without it.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1427":"Your story was so long I've forgotten half of it!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1428":"And misunderstood the other half...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1429":"The Embodiment of Vices arrived from another world. A dark energy threatens the Dominion, but with you alongside him, the sage can still win.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_143":"Well, I like them a lot, even though I'm a statue. Holidays have their magic!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1430":"Evil cannot create anything new!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1431":"Hello, my old friend. Are you ready to be defeated once more?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1432":"The heavens alone are out of my reach, for I have neither legs nor wings.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1433":"The heavens have always been free. No one occupies them. Neither you, nor I, nor even the titans. But now it's time to fill in the endless void of the heavens. From now on... I will be their master!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1434":"I still don't follow, but I feel like we need to intervene.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1435":"Do you see now, heroes? If you lose, you will be unable to return. All you can do is win!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1436":"You might have won this time, old man, but I'm still a part of you, now and ever. I'll be back.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1437":"I am in possession of my mind once more. I can finally speak clearly.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1438":"Are you sure?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1439":"Don't get cocky with me, young lad!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_144":"Pfft! Nonsense.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1440":"Oh, where are my manners... I appreciate your help, mighty heroes. I couldn't have done this without you.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1441":"The road we've taken has made us stronger and wiser. I can feel it.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1442":"You deserve some rest. Our village will always be indebted to you.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1443":"So... can we go to the hot springs now?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1444":"And so, the tale of the mysterious village ends. Our heroes have grown more experienced, ready to take on new challenges.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1445":"But only after a short break...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1446":"There's a smell of burning in the air. Did you summon us, Fafnir? What's the rush?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1447":"Looks like the forest was attacked by my kin.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1448":"They never embraced the peaceful way of life, but they have never attacked this forest before.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1449":"Did you witness the attack? Are you sure it was dragons? Could it be demons?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_145":"It's just not the same without a costume.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1450":"I didn't see the attack, no. I hid in this forest to study rune magic. It has always been quiet here.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1451":"What about your dragon friends?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1452":"I haven't heard anything from my home village for the last few months.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1453":"It's never happened before. The dragons have always heeded the call of their kin.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1454":"We'll have to go deep into the forest. That's the only way to find out what's going on.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1455":"We'll have to make it past the lands of the centaurs. If the chaos around here is any indication, I doubt the centaurs will be overjoyed to see us.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1456":"No matter how hard I tried to hide, my past seems to have caught up with me...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1457":"I've never seen centaurs so enraged before.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1458":"Take a good look at the trees. Despite this place's natural power, the tree trunks are burned and cracked from the heat.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1459":"Look at all the grooves in the ground. There was a battle here, but there are no tracks leading to or from the grove.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_146":"Hey, let's see if that magic actually exists! It's winter now, right? And everyone's talking about the winter magic! Why don't you go outside and ask winter for a costume?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1460":"Sudden assaults are one of the preferred tactics of my kin. Now I'm sure it was them.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1461":"But why did they attack this place?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1462":"Help me return to my home village. We'll find out what happened and quell the rage of my kin.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1463":"We'll help you. That's what friends are for.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1464":"The only way to go up to my home village is by the drommer elevator.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1465":"Back when I still lived alongside other dragons, they preferred to maintain peace with the drommer folk in exchange for defending the elevator from foreigners.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1466":"That way, they could leave for months to raid other settlements while the young ones grew up in the safety of their home.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1467":"Beep... Traitors to the pact...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1468":"Wait. I'm a dragon too. I'm heading home, and they're my...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1469":"Beep... Request denied. The pact is no longer valid...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_147":"Hah! He went. So naive!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1470":"Fafnir, we don't have time for this! This pile of scrap metal is going to summon the entire drommer village if it keeps going...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1471":"I don't understand why the dragons would violate the peace treaty with the drommers.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1472":"Apparently, even dragons find it hard to resist dark temptations.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1473":"Darkness only consumes those weak in spirit, but the light will prevail in the end.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1474":"We just need to make sure it doesn't blind us for good.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1475":"The dragons might not have been paragons of peace, but they weren't the embodiment of pure evil either.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1476":"I can't believe Akshar, the village elder, let this happen.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1477":"We've arrived at last. Here lies the dragon village.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1478":"You shall not pass. The basilisk is guarding the canyon.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1479":"What's going on? Why haven't I been hearing from my kin in the village?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_148":"By the bolt and wrench, it actually happened!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1480":"The basilisk doesn't know. He hasn't visited in ages. You shall not pass. Akshar is wicked. The basilisk won't dare disobey him.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1481":"He's not himself... His will is subdued by darkness. I can sense it.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1482":"Do you suggest that we \"educate\" him?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1483":"Do you have any other suggestions?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1484":"Now that's odd. No dragons ever wore reins.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1485":"Let's take them off him and see what happens.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1486":"The basilisk won't let you. The basilisk is strong.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1487":"Finally, the voice no longer haunts me. I'm sore all over...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1488":"Now wait just a moment...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1489":"Thank you for healing my body and spirit.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_149":"Thanks for the advice! Now I feel the holiday spirit. I hope you do, too!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1490":"Tell us where those reins came from.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1491":"Akshar gave them to me a year ago. I thought it was a gift of peace, but it was a trap.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1492":"What happened in the village?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1493":"Soon after you left, a dark sorcerer arrived in the village. He helped us raid. Soon, he and Akshar grew close.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1494":"I won't be surprised if he's the one who crafted those reins.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1495":"I never left this place because of the foul magic binding me. I don't know what has happened in the village since.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1496":"A year spent guarding this place has made me ravenous. If you don't have any more urgent questions, I'd like to go out there and hunt.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1497":"Ash and ruins are all that's left of my home... The forge where I smithed my first blades is now but a pile of rubble.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1498":"The wretched war has corrupted this place...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1499":"Who do you think could have done this? I doubt dragons would go down without a fight.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_15":"Be careful, Galahad!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_150":"What do I have to do to make the engineers that invited me here appear at last?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1500":"If the devastation we're seeing is anything to go by, the attackers used all-consuming magic fire to burn the place down.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1501":"The basilisk survived, so it couldn't have been foreigners. No dragon is capable of breathing that kind of fire, though.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1502":"I can't see any dragon carcasses around here. However, I did sense traces of necromantic energy as soon as we arrived.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1503":"Arrrrgh!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1504":"Well, that's one riddle solved.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1505":"I never even had the chance to say goodbye.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1506":"Loneliness can hurt you more than blazing magic fire. But you'll always have us. Remember that.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1507":"We'll say our goodbyes to those who are gone. Soon, this place will be teeming with life. All of the dragons couldn't have perished here.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1508":"The vile necromancer will pay for desecrating this place.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1509":"I don't think a single necromancer is capable of all this.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_151":"If cheap magic tricks are what it takes for us to meet each other, I'm ready.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1510":"We must find Akshar. He mustn't have let this bloodshed come to pass.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1511":"Aksharrr!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1512":"What is it, youngster?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1513":"What have you done?! What happened to the village?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1514":"How dare you speak to me so! Those filthy traitors deserved what they got. They stole from me!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1515":"The slimy lizards refused to share the plunder and tried to conceal it from me, but Sandro opened my eyes to their schemes.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1516":"So you destroyed the village and murdered your kin for gold?!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1517":"One more word of disrespect, and I'll take your life as well!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1518":"I only killed those who chose to defend their homes. Homes packed full of my gold.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1519":"A dozen was enough. The rest scattered like the pathetic cowards they are.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_152":"Cheap magic tricks? I vehemently disagree, young man.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1520":"Look at his opalescent scales! They're imbued with the power of water, which grants incredible firmness. No dragon fire can melt such armor.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1521":"That's Sandro's gift to me, paladin. Your little tricks are no match for my armor. Now leave! I can see the flame of greed burning in your eyes!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1522":"You're mad! You lost all your wisdom! It's the blazing fire of revenge!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1523":"You were warned.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1524":"Whoa! I can feel a sticky cold from Akshar's blood burning within me as it fills me from the inside.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1525":"The dragon blood and the magic cast upon him have imbued me with newfound power!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1526":"A slain dragon's blood is imbued with the dragon's magic power... But to possess that power, you must pay too high a price.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1527":"The code of the dragons has no punishment for a crime as terrible as his. There's no forgiveness for kinslayers.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1528":"Don't blame yourself. Sometimes being decisive is the only way. It was Akshar who passed the point of no return.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1529":"Besides, there are more of your kin out there. We can still save them.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_153":"Ten years ago or so, a group of children was brought to Strongford from faraway lands. Right on Winterfest Eve, too!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1530":"I hope we can find them so the village still has a future.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1531":"Why would the necromancer imbue Akshar's scales with that power?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1532":"No matter his motives, there's no denying that the necromancer is up to no good.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1533":"Thank you for helping me get rid of Akshar. He'll be a general in my army, leading undead dragons to battle.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1534":"These dragons are hard to kill, but they do make for excellent undead.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1535":"So it was you who incited Akshar to kill his kin!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1536":"Yes, and the plan worked perfectly. Dragons have been obsessed with gold since the dawn of time.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1537":"All I did was sow the seeds and gently push Akshar to doubt his kin.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1538":"The armor was an overkill, though. Akshar was supposed to die in that battle. Even I am prone to greed, it seems.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1539":"Forcing dragons to kill other dragons to build an undead army? Desecrating this place? I won't allow this!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_154":"Ugh, I asked for it...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1540":"You pesky paladins just can't mind your own business.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1541":"Exsurge serpentes!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1542":"I can't believe he's transformed so many dragons...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1543":"I've never seen anyone summon such powerful creatures that fast. He must be drawing that energy from somewhere...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1544":"We must stop him before he flees along with his undead army.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1545":"Now is the time for you to transform as well, my little birds!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1546":"Ssshah!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1547":"Ow!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1548":"Ow ow ow!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1549":"Lumus dimittis compedibus!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_155":"The kids gathered around the Winterfest tree to watch the holiday lights. All of a sudden, the tree burst into flames!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1550":"You turncoats! Filthy wyrms! Traitors!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1551":"Oh well. If you want something done, do it yourself...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1552":"That's one necromancer less to worry about! Had we arrived just a day later, Sandro and his dragon army would have threatened the entire Dominion.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1553":"What matters is that we've saved these babies. The village will come alive again.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1554":"I'll educate them so that tragedy never repeats itself.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1555":"I'm glad you've reunited with your kin.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_1556":"All these challenges only proved I did the right thing by joining the family of the Guardians.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_156":"But I conjured a magic tree in its place at once. The kids didn't even notice!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_157":"I know this story well. I was one of those kids. The only one who didn't receive a gift, too.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_158":"This is just the time for you to get a surprise Winterfest gift, then! Here you are!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_159":"Thank you!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_16":"You've taken your sweet time!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_160":"Maybe I should've told him I had seen the tree catch fire... That's when I decided magic was all about cheap tricks.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_161":"What does this weirdo think he's doing, barging into the inn and beating everyone up with that stick?!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_162":"Excuse me! Stop it, or I'll have to intervene!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_163":"It's alright, boy. Some people have been hanging around so long, it's no surprise they couldn't keep sober.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_164":"But why bash their heads with a mace?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_165":"Hahaha, now that was funny! It's my way of healing them. For Winterfest, y'know. It's my talent.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_166":"Please keep in mind that I feel perfectly healthy!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_167":"Hahaha! Good for you! Here's your gift, then!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_168":"Isaac looked up to see a stranger in a peculiar festive costume enter the inn.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_169":"A feather fell from his costume to the floor, followed by a couple of blotches.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_17":"I found Mojo's tracks! The goblins were keeping him in a cage. They took him away a few hours ago, at the most.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_170":"Apparently, your birds love a good meal. And it shows!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_171":"You got a problem with my birds? I'll show you...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_172":"Oops! Nothing happened! Curious, huh?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_173":"Incredible!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_174":"You can't steal energy from those who have none. My devices do everything for me. Got it?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_175":"Now, now. Relax! It's a holiday, after all!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_176":"No offense taken! Besides, how could I be angry at someone wearing such an awesome outfit? Ooh, that's another blotch!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_177":"Are you making fun of me? I love these birds, you know! Here, take your gift and chill!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_178":"Tes'Lin, just a little longer, dear. Do you want me to dismount so you can stretch your servodrives?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_179":"Your lights are getting dimmer, Tes'Lin. The batteries are running low on charge!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_18":"The wicked orc Gro Bulgor has been defeated, and his camp looks deserted.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_180":"Excuse me, if I may... Is Tes'Lin your magic orb?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_181":"No, she's my electric self-propelled vehicle. Er... if you can make sense of what I'm saying, of course.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_182":"Why, us mages know nothing about these things.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_183":"Yeah, I could tell as much.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_184":"All we can do is make these silly gestures and tap on the ground with our staves.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_185":"That's right.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_186":"Naturally, we're anything but tech-savvy. All we need is a star-covered mantle and a bunch of enchanted amulets.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_187":"Absolutely.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_188":"Do you need a battery, my friend? Because I have one.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_189":"Oh... Yes, please! Thank you!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_19":"You don't have to ask me twice!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_190":"Here, take another gift from us old-fashioned mages!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_191":"I'm not sure what happened, but the festive spirit really started kicking in! I feel the urge to live!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_192":"Well, I don't! Too bad I have no choice but to live on.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_193":"Care to tell me about it?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_194":"I was killed quite some time ago, you see. But then my daughter took up dark magic as a hobby and brought me back to life! Eternal life, that is.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_195":"So disrespectful! Why wouldn't she obey her father?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_196":"Oh, come on. That's youth for you. Just you wait, perhaps a few decades or so.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_197":"You'll get to see your granddaughter disobey her mother! The perfect revenge, I say.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_198":"Why, you're a very funny young man. If you see Morrigan, please tell her I'm looking for her.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_199":"Hah! So I'm not the only one who's too lazy to walk.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_2":"Huh... You wait here. I'll check it out.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_20":"Mission completed!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_200":"Right! Why don't you keep me company?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_201":"I'd love to, but I have company of my own.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_202":"And where is it, exactly?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_203":"Here are my three skeleton friends. Benny, Bonny, and the third one.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_204":"Why doesn't the third one have a name?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_205":"Whenever I try asking his name, he just crumbles down.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_206":"You necromancers and your problems... Why don't you go visit your old man, by the way? He's been looking for you!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_207":"Oops! Here's your gift. Don't tell Dad I've been here!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_208":"Hey, I'm looking for Isaac! Is he here?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_209":"Who lets a little girl into a tavern? That can't be legal, can it?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_21":"Mojo! You're alive!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_210":"Do I hear that from a little boy riding a mecha-spider?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_211":"Aw, come on, calm down. I'm Isaac. Are you the engineer I've almost lost hope to meet?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_212":"Yeah. My name's Fox. Sorry I'm late, had to leave the city on urgent business.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_213":"We're here together to help the world overcome the challenge that awaits us.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_214":"Hey, I love new challenges! But we're just engineers. What exactly can we do?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_215":"To find the answer to this question, you'll have to wait a bit longer.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_216":"Even longer?!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_217":"It'll be worth it, Isaac! Besides, you won't be alone. I'll join you here.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_218":"Also, before I forget, let me make up for your time with this gift!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_219":"Look who the cat dragged in!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_22":"The spirits told me you'd come for me. Mojo knew and awaited!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_220":"At last! Everyone's here!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_221":"Isaac, meet Ginger. Ginger, meet Isaac.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_222":"Hello... You're quite the... uh...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_223":"Quite the engineer, and the daughter of Duke of Coldfield, Ginger Hayes?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_224":"Yes, that's exactly what I was about to say.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_225":"Okay, let's get to it. A new challenge awaits the Dominion in the upcoming year. It's time to show what we're made of.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_226":"So I hereby announce the founding of the Dominion's Engineering Guild!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_227":"I'm all for it! What do we need to do?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_228":"Keep upgrading our inventions and stick together in battles. That's vital!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_229":"I've calibrated Fox and I's automated profile to recognize you, Isaac. From now on, you can boost our skills.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_23":"So, what brings you here, Mojo?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_230":"Whoa! It's been worth the wait. Let's do this, my fellow guildmates!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_231":"Well then, now that we've reached an agreement, it's time to get to work.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_232":"Isaac, will you stay in Strongford?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_233":"That's actually a good idea. I like this city.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_234":"I think I'll stay here and show my genius to the world!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_235":"I already have some grand ideas...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_236":"Ladies! Wait for me!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_237":"Devilspawn!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_238":"Keira!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_239":"You're not talking about us, are you?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_24":"Mission... Mojo the shaman must destroy poison. Nasty orcs spread poison! Nature is dying.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_240":"Also, what are you doing here? Searching for someone? Who is it?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_241":"Someone who deserves to die a slow, painful death.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_242":"Um... Could you be more specific?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_243":"Wild satyrs. Those nasty, giant horned beasts, hooves and all.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_244":"I believe one of them gave us a dressing-down just a moment ago.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_245":"I'll deal with him. Show me the way!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_246":"We did it!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_247":"Keira did it, not us.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_248":"What does it matter? We're a team!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_249":"Yeah. Right.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_25":"So that's how the Deadlands got their name...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_250":"Hey Keira, why are you so angry with that wild satyr?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_251":"On my way to Wilheim, I encountered farmers who had lost their homes.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_252":"Wild satyrs had trampled all over their crops and pillaged their food supplies.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_253":"The poor villagers are doomed to starve now. I swore I'd avenge them!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_254":"Let's hurry up, then! I recall seeing another horned beast around here.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_255":"Devilspawn!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_256":"Keira!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_257":"You're not talking about us, are you?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_258":"Also, what are you doing here? Searching for someone? Who is it?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_259":"Someone you granted an easy death to, instead of the slow and painful one they deserved...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_26":"I can see cisterns filled with black poison.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_260":"Um... Could you be more specific?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_261":"Wild satyrs. Those nasty, giant horned beasts, hooves and all.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_262":"Indeed. We gave one of them a dressing-down just a moment ago.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_263":"Why are you so angry with that wild satyr?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_264":"On my way to Wilheim, I encountered farmers who had lost their homes.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_265":"Wild satyrs had trampled all over their crops and pillaged their food supplies.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_266":"The poor villagers are doomed to starve now. I swore I'd avenge them!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_267":"Let's hurry up, then. I recall seeing another horned beast around here.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_268":"Hah! One more marauder, done for!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_269":"Yeah! There's not much left of him!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_27":"Come now, Galahad, you've made me worry!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_270":"And yet they left those farmers nothing at all.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_271":"Right. We must find the others.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_272":"You'll regret crossing our path!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_273":"The fields will never be safe from our hooves, and neither will you!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_274":"The fairies will reward us when we bring them your heads!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_275":"Fairies? Yeah, like anyone would believe that! Get them!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_276":"The only reward you shall reap is a swift death.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_277":"Stay alert, my friends. Somehow, I sense the satyr just might have been telling the truth...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_278":"These satyrs are a bit on the smaller side...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_279":"They couldn't have trampled the crops. We've yet to fight the large ones.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_28":"That's so sweet of you, my darling!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_280":"There's no time to waste. Justice must be served!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_281":"The vermin and marauders are no more. The farmers can rest easy now.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_282":"I guess I underestimated the power of the fairies...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_283":"Who knows how this would end if it hadn't been for Keira.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_284":"I fear this is not the end, my friends.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_285":"The creatures of the forest were once kind and peaceful...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_286":"Until the Archdemon's distorted magic transformed them into evil monsters.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_287":"I'm truly sorry, my friends. To stop the Archdemon, I must move on and leave our team.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_288":"I'm pretty sure it's on our way too. Together, we make a great team!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_289":"That's right! Join us, Keira! We could use your battle prowess, and we'll help you banish evil from the Dominion!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_29":"Argh, my ears! Even mead flows less sweetly than your speeches.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_290":"The Old Grove is a sacred place for the Keepers of arcane ancestral knowledge.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_291":"However, the grove is dying. Its trees are withering, its beasts turning rabid for no reason.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_292":"The cause is corruption... It looks much like what my ancestors, the ancient elves, once fought.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_293":"They would've never defeated it without the Keepers.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_294":"Such as the legendary Alvanor.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_295":"I wonder if he's still alive.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_296":"He is, but he has lain in deep slumber for several centuries.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_297":"I believe the time has come for Alvanor to awaken.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_298":"Indeed. According to the chronicles, the Keeper's tomb","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_299":"is right here, in the Old Grove.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_3":"I got caught in a trap. That was a close call.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_30":"Goblins ahead!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_300":"Those ruins to the west... I think I know where we can find Alvanor.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_301":"Wake up, hero. The time has come!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_302":"Hey, what does this mean?! My squad was the first to find corruption in the Old Grove.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_303":"It happened right here!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_304":"I found no sources of corruption in the tomb, though.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_305":"You don't believe me? My archers are perceptive. They serve these woods!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_306":"Know this: the corruption is here!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_307":"Hush, my friends. Keep silent. Alvanor needs to recover.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_308":"Ugh, have it your way! Mark our words, you'll remember this!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_309":"You're in the Old Grove once more, Alvanor!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_31":"Mojo sees a tank full of poison. Angry are the spirits, for nature will suffer once more!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_310":"How startling. Astounding!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_311":"If I didn't feel so sick,","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_312":"I never would have noticed the difference after so many centuries of deep slumber.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_313":"My grove! Trees and meadows all around...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_314":"We've awakened you for a reason, glorious Keeper. The corruption is spreading in the Old Grove yet again!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_315":"We are deeply troubled. We're scared.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_316":"By the Forerunners! That is concerning. Indeed, I can sense a corrupted presence in here.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_317":"We must purify the forests, but my powers are exhausted. I cannot feel the breath of the grove, nor use its magic runes.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_318":"Great Alvanor, if you join us, we...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_319":"We'll find the runes and revive them!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_32":"Let's turn the enemies' own weapon against them!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_320":"Doom! Doom and destruction!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_321":"Werewolves in the Old Grove? I won't stand for this!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_322":"Ooh! It feels as though the corruption is following us, rather than the other way around.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_323":"How are these beasts roaming the sacred forest? It's absurd!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_324":"And I couldn't even help. I feel weak and frail, as though old age is getting the best of me.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_325":"Alvanor, you are no longer young. No longer young at all, I'd say.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_326":"Actually, you're pretty much ancient! May I call you Grandpa?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_327":"The youth nowadays! Always with their little jokes! Tell you what, let's head to the runes.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_328":"This is the relic forest. It has changed a lot since I was last here.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_329":"What I'm seeing is hardly a forest at all. Nothing but tree stumps and rotten brushwood.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_33":"The monsters have been punished!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_330":"It's the corruption. It taints all life it touches.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_331":"It pulls the worst, darkest parts in us to the surface.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_332":"These trees are beyond help. However, we can breathe life into new and untainted plants.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_333":"I'll do anything to save the Old Grove!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_334":"Let's raze all of this to the ground, then!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_335":"A strange-looking storm is headed towards Strongford from the west.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_336":"The scouts are reporting that this is the handiwork of the leader of the Chaos forces.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_337":"Her name is Xe'Sha, if I recall. So much for simple names!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_338":"It's not just any storm, either. It's a truly fearsome mass of dark energy! Can you see it?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_339":"It's kind of difficult not to...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_34":"Mojo happy. So happy!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_340":"Mira, do you have a plan this time?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_341":"Ugh... I wish I could figure out what else that monstrosity of a woman is planning...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_342":"I believe you'll have to take your chance, Guardians. You will head straight into the storm. And...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_343":"Take me along. I can sense it's the right thing to do.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_344":"My amulet is vibrating. I've never seen the Beacon do this before... I'm scared.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_345":"You are absolutely right to be scared of me!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_346":"Who might you be, Xe'Sha? What brings you to the Dominion?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_347":"It's none of your business, wench! The storm will avenge me!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_348":"Don't listen to her, Guardians. Beware, the storm acts like a living creature.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_349":"It attacks us with its own force. The Force of the Storm!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_35":"Farewell, Gro Bulgor, you awful creature!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_350":"Well said. But the forces of nature heed no words.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_351":"Do not let the Force of the Storm destroy you. Over here! Run to the center!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_352":"Don't! That voice is a trick. The closer to the center of the storm, the more dangerous it gets!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_353":"The enemies of the Dominion can't be trusted, Xe'Sha! You hear me?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_354":"Of course I do, my dear.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_355":"You're going to die, the lot of you!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_356":"Your amulet! Every time we defeat monsters, it pulsates.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_357":"In these moments, I sense that the Beacon's energy grows and the destructive Force of the Storm fades.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_358":"The amulet is shielding you, Guardians. It increases your Storm Resistance!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_359":"Which means there's still a chance to defeat this enemy. We just need to keep fighting!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_36":"I hope the goblins and orcs leave these lands at last.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_360":"Xe'Sha challenged us to reach the very center, the core of the storm.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_361":"Obviously, it won't be easy to get there.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_362":"What if it's the crucial element of the storm? The very heart of it, its source.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_363":"Did you see those three giant crystals, looking like watchtowers?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_364":"I think the crystals feed the core of the storm with energy and protect it.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_365":"In that case, we need to disarm them so we can reach the heart of the storm!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_366":"The Beacon! It's pulsating with light!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_367":"We destroyed the tower. The core is just ahead.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_368":"You yet live? What a pity!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_369":"Why, yes. We're just about to destroy the storm... along with you!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_37":"It's so creepy here...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_370":"An arrogant fool! Still, I'd like to see you try.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_371":"After all, it's the only way for me to get hold of that bauble of yours!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_372":"It's my amulet, and it's one of a kind across the worlds!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_373":"I couldn't care less! I'll just take it from you.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_374":"The storm is growing more powerful.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_375":"Harbinger! Soon, you will arrive to this world.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_376":"And bring it to ruin!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_377":"This is my gift to you, o great one! My revenge on the Dominion!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_378":"Give me your name, insolent wench!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_379":"I'm Mira. Don't bother giving me yours, I already know it.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_38":"Mojo seems ill at ease, too. This is our last target!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_380":"I also know that you possess something similar to my Beacon.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_381":"It conjures the Force of the Storm, the exact opposite of my Resistance.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_382":"Their inner energy aside, these items share a common nature, don't they?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_383":"Don't waste your breath, you pathetic insect! You're going to die, the lot of you!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_384":"Shame I won't be here to witness it. Duty calls...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_385":"Your victory means nothing whatsoever.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_386":"There will be another crystal, and another storm!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_387":"You own an amulet that resembles my Beacon. Think about it, Xe'Sha.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_388":"What if we're both...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_389":"Begone! Your words matter naught to me.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_39":"Well then, time to have some fun!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_390":"Soon, I will deal the next blow and open the gate for the great Harbinger!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_391":"The rune has shown itself to me! A few horrendous tree stumps seemed to be opposing it vehemently, though.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_392":"Did you hear what they said?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_393":"Don't mind them. They're just tree stumps, after all.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_394":"\"The corruption is here,\" they creaked.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_395":"There's a meaning to their words... We just need to understand it.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_396":"This is the place! The Rune of Earth is here.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_397":"The runic altar appears to have been abandoned. How many years has it just stood here?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_398":"Plenty, I believe. Only a select few can make use of runic power.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_399":"By the Forerunners! I fear I'm doomed to be the last Keeper of all the peoples.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_4":"But I realized we found the Archdemon's outpost! I destroyed the tower and deprived the army of the Darkness of reinforcements! Not half bad, huh?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_40":"Is descending to the toxic dungeons of the Chaos Realm really your idea of fun?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_400":"Alvanor, please, just do what you must.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_401":"Activate the Rune of Earth!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_402":"What's wrong with our souls? I know mine is pure.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_403":"Same here. All our souls are good and pure enough.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_404":"Their suspicions are insulting! Their doubts are demeaning!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_405":"Their actions are unacceptable! They deserve the harshest puni...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_406":"Alvanor, you're scaring me! This is the first time I've seen you like this.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_407":"Oh, uh... Indeed. I must have lost my nerve. How awkward...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_408":"I'm feeling much better now.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_409":"What I wouldn't give to spread my feathers and fly!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_41":"Naturally! Well now, off I go.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_410":"You don't have wings, though.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_411":"That's the point. As grateful as I am to the Creators, why did they make me look like this?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_412":"Not a centaur, not a bird, not an elf... Who am I?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_413":"Oh, come on. You're... quite striking.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_414":"Well, thank you.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_415":"Look at you, chatting all the way to the next altar.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_416":"The Rune of Nature is here!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_417":"Thieves! Vandals! Desecrators!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_418":"Go away! The dryads aren't your friends!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_419":"These ladies are gorgeous, with an attitude to match.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_42":"Wasn't it you who screamed in fear down there?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_420":"If only I were a younger man...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_421":"Ahem... With all due respect, Alvanor, I suggest that you proceed.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_422":"Of course, my dear.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_423":"I'm utterly exhausted. Alas, my friends, even the power of the runes won't sustain me.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_424":"How are we to banish the corruption if I...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_425":"Don't worry, Alvanor. It's going to be alright!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_426":"Don't you dare interrupt me, boy! Did you forget who I am?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_427":"Oh. What's gotten into me...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_428":"I beg your forgiveness, Kai. I do not know what possessed me.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_429":"Um... Don't worry. It's just, well... it's a bit odd.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_43":"Well, maybe just once. A nasty goblin gave me a scare. A tiny little scare, that's all.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_430":"Actually, it's time for us to proceed. Off to find the Rune of Life we go!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_431":"There's something off about him.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_432":"You mean Alvanor?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_433":"Of course I mean Alvanor!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_434":"I happened to overhear you. I just wanted to say my outburst cannot be justified!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_435":"Please accept this small gift, a token of my contrition.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_436":"The Rune of Life has attuned to me, and I wanted to share its power with you.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_437":"From now onward, when we head into battle together, you will be recovering health. Plenty of health!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_438":"I thank you for this generous gift, Alvanor. Still, it is you who needs to recover...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_439":"Silence! This matter isn't up for discussion.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_44":"Jokes? Mojo is serious.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_440":"I need to think something over. I'll see you tomorrow.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_441":"Day by day, we encountered the corruption.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_442":"Time and again, we enraged the faithful Guardians of the Old Grove.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_443":"The corruption followed us. And so, I finally understood.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_444":"I... am the source of the corruption!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_445":"No... No! How is that possible?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_446":"Century after century, deep in my slumber, I was corrupted without ever realizing it.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_447":"The vile taint spread as it waited for its time to come. Soon, it left the tomb.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_448":"And now it is devouring me from within. Hour by hour, I am losing my very self.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_449":"And so I have made my decision. If I myself am the enemy, my ailing, vile side must be defeated!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_45":"Mojo and Artemis are leaving. An order has just arrived from the capital.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_450":"My friends and allies! At last, I can breathe freely.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_451":"My mind is clear as day.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_452":"I've purged my soul of corruption. It's time to purify the Old Grove.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_453":"Now this is the legendary hero in his true form!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_454":"Welcome to my grove, Alvanor! The corruption no longer stands a chance!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_455":"Heed my call...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_456":"Grovel before its might!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_457":"Come...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_458":"Lotley, the tide is rising.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_459":"Yeah, I can tell, Zoin. Human's still asleep, though.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_46":"What do I have to do?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_460":"They're twitching. Having a nightmare?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_461":"They're not asleep! Eyes open, see? Get up, human!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_462":"Look, we, uh, need help. You help us!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_463":"Hey, let's be nice. If we're nice, the human will help.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_464":"Human! You help us! PLEASE!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_465":"Didn't you see the water bubbling while you slept, human?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_466":"And something huge stirring deep under the sea? Shame, it sure was a sight to behold!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_467":"Everyone's been having nightmares ever since. Lotley is afraid to shut his eyes.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_468":"Monsters crawl from the sea as the tide devours everything...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_469":"Us? No, we ain't no monsters. We're the victims here.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_47":"Find Aurora on the plains of the Split of Tribes.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_470":"Aaaah! Something's approaching! Lotley's scared! Banish the monster!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_471":"Help us, won't you, human? If you do, I'll tell you what happened.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_472":"You're strong, human. You can help us. Help us so much!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_473":"Thing is, we're also humans. We're just cursed real bad. Tell them, Zoin!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_474":"Yeah, we're totally humans! From the nearby village, we are. We're lazy, and that's what saved us.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_475":"Everyone went to the shore to check the fishing nets, and we stayed in the backyard to enjoy the sunshine.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_476":"And look what happened to us. We're fishfolk now!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_477":"And that's not the worst part. I shudder to imagine what happened to folks on the shore.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_478":"Yeah. They're evil monsters now. The tentacles! The claws!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_479":"So, you help us, human. Save our neighbors. Make them normal and good, like they always were.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_48":"So, where's Aurora? Have I come here for naught?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_480":"If you dispel that magic, maybe we'll become normal too?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_481":"After all, you're still normal. Who knows why you weren't transformed...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_482":"I named them my children, and gifted them with the colossal power of the Dark Depths.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_483":"Join them, mortal. Bow before me! Accept me as your master!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_484":"Wakey, wakey! Get up. You promised you'd help our neighbors!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_485":"Don't be rude, Lotley. Can't you see they're being plagued by nightmares again?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_486":"Sorry, human. Save our neighbors, will you? PLEASE DO!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_487":"So, our elder and his daughter are the first. Always been deathly pale, those two, but now...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_488":"The girl's still a treat to look at! The man looks like he just rose from the grave, though.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_489":"Oh, and they'd also summon demons from the underworld at night!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_49":"Who's that? Galahad, is that you? Help me!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_490":"Still, they were lovely neighbors. Nice and quiet. Always clean, too!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_491":"Shut up, Lotley!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_492":"Look here, human. Once they were turned, they became even stronger than before.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_493":"Maybe you could beat them up real bad and dispel the magic. Y'know, make them normal again?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_494":"Can you at least try? You're one powerful human!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_495":"They took my power!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_496":"Indeed, Father. Mine as well.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_497":"Just like that! Boom! No more scary and powerful monsters!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_498":"Just ordinary humans.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_499":"Thank you, human. I'm kinda sorry you're having nightmares.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_5":"Stop blowing your own trumpet, Galahad!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_50":"Hang in there! I'll save you! I'm coming!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_500":"You seem alright.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_501":"You took away the gift of the Dark Depths from my beloved children.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_502":"You anger me, mortal!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_503":"The abyss awaits you, so dark and endlessly deep...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_504":"What's going on, Zoin? Over there, on the cliff on our right.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_505":"That's some occult business right there. Look! They're worshipping that which lurks in the depths...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_506":"Hey, you there! Our human's going to make fried fish out of ya!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_507":"Our human's going to give you what for!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_508":"Lotley, you moron! Can't you stay quiet? Look what you've done!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_509":"Oh. Uh oh... Are they after us?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_51":"I only got distracted for a second, but it was enough to end up in this trap! So silly of me!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_510":"Save us, human. Or we won't get to meet the rest of our neighbors!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_511":"Fall back!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_512":"By the lurker in the depths... We'll get you next time!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_513":"We barely made it!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_514":"If the human hadn't helped, we'd have made nothing at all.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_515":"I can see our neighbors! Ugh, they sure look scary now.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_516":"Brrr... And yet they're so strong and powerful!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_517":"So, what are we waiting for?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_518":"Let's return them back to normal! We just might lift the curse from ourselves, too!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_519":"Wait, Zoin. Let me catch my breath!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_52":"Let that be a good lesson for both of us. Dangers untold lie ahead, and we must always be prepared to face them.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_520":"Don't you dare touch my servants...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_521":"Bow... Submit...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_522":"Wake up! It's time to go, human.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_523":"Yeah, we need to hurry and save our neighbors.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_524":"They're two brothers. A bit distant, and their sense of humor is on the weird side.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_525":"Yeah. Phil and Carl. Their jokes can literally kill!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_526":"Let's save our neighbors! Y'know, lift the curse, return them back to normal.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_527":"Do it, human! Please!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_528":"My precious! The power of the Dark Depths was taken from me!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_529":"Yeah, Phil. Don't worry, it's over. Go get some rest.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_53":"It's heart-wrenching to think our loyal Mojo has been captured by enemies.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_530":"You did so well, human! Thanks so much for saving our neighbors!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_531":"You're so good, so skilled, so...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_532":"Ugh! Lotley, will you please shut up already!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_533":"Have you defied me, mortal?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_534":"Have you disobeyed the will of the Master of the Abyss?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_535":"My heir will decide your fate!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_536":"Something's rising from the water. Something huge!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_537":"Defeat it, human!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_538":"What do you mean, you don't want to? Are you scared of your nightmare?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_539":"Hey, that's not what we agreed on.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_54":"We'll find him, Artemis. I know we will!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_540":"We all see nightmares, but we're still moving forward.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_541":"We need to save those who succumbed to the Master of the Abyss. That's what matters.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_542":"It's all for a good cause. You help us, human!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_543":"That sure was a scary one. Ugh!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_544":"If that was the heir, what does the dad look like? Y'know, the one whispering in our nightmares.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_545":"I-I don't think I want to know that. Let's go ahead and save the rest of our neighbors.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_546":"They're evil and very powerful. And then they'll be normal and totally good!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_547":"You draw ever closer... To my revenge!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_548":"Fool! Having dared to defy me, you'll find no mercy!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_549":"I'm hungry. I could eat a whole...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_55":"We'll search every nook and cranny, every single tower...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_550":"Oh! Good morning, good human.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_551":"That's right. Today's an important day!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_552":"We're going to save the last of our neighbors. Then, no more!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_553":"We're gonna be sooo good!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_554":"Ahhh! How wonderful!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_555":"So very wonderful!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_556":"Yeah, it's pretty good. The human helped us save all our neighbors.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_557":"They don't look all that awful anymore. What did they need with all that power anyway?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_558":"Yeah, you did very well! Good human!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_559":"We have a gift for you. You'll find out all about it tomorrow. For now, get some rest.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_56":"Speaking of towers, one of them stands right before you.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_560":"You're here. You have come. You will submit!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_561":"Now I am your master!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_562":"I AM YOUR MASTER!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_563":"Hush, Lotley. Don't wake the human...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_564":"Still, it sure turned out great in the end!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_565":"Yes! Good, very good!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_566":"The human drove away those posers and took their power! Now we're the Master's head servants!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_567":"Grovel, you filthy maggots! Where's the human?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_568":"Right here, Master.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_569":"We did everything as you asked, Master.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_57":"I didn't find Mojo, but I definitely want to thank the orcs.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_570":"We didn't hurt anyone. We just brought them here.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_571":"But the human thumped your other servants. Poor things!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_572":"Silence. You will be punished for your deceit!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_573":"Oooh. Uh oh...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_574":"You conspired with the human to deprive my servants of my gift, the power of the Dark Depths. You took what was mine!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_575":"But... We...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_576":"And you, human... You're special. You didn't transform like the rest of them. Didn't succumb to my call.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_577":"You could've become my viceroy on land. But you just had to ruin everything!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_578":"And now you'll pay the price!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_579":"Get up, human!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_58":"What? Are you quite sane, partner?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_580":"Ugh, come on! Are you just gonna lie there?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_581":"We, uh... We wanted to apologize. For bringing you to the Master.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_582":"And for using you to get rid of our rivals. The ones with the gift of the Dark Depths, I mean.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_583":"Also, we ain't no humans. Been fishfolk all our lives.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_584":"Bound to serve the immortal Master for all eternity.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_585":"We had no idea you had the special mark! A rare mark!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_586":"That's what helped you defeat the Master.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_587":"And... Since he's dead anyway, can we serve you instead?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_588":"It's our duty...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_589":"Lotley, did you hear that? The human said they're setting us free.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_59":"Leaving behind a written order to transport a certain prisoner to Hardan's Plateau was inconceivably stupid of them!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_590":"What do you mean, Zoin? Can we, uh, do whatever we want or something?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_591":"Eat all we want, too? Sing aloud? Never obey orders?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_592":"Of course, Lotley. You and I are now free birds!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_593":"Free fishes, you mean? Or something like that?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_594":"Ugh, Lotley! Don't take it literally!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_595":"Oooh! Thank you, human. We promise we'll be good from now on.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_596":"Lotley will help everyone. Lotley will love all people!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_597":"I don't recognize this place. Is this snow or ash? The Valkyrie Sisters couldn't have gotten the address wrong, could they?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_598":"Move asi-i-ide!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_599":"Hey there, little fellow! What's the hurry?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_6":"Oh no! The city's on fire! What's going on here?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_60":"Ah, I see now. Let's head to the plateau!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_600":"I'm not a little fellow, young lady! I'm the King of the North, and I've come here to fight the demons! Very well, though, I will not say no to your humble support.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_601":"Grab him! He probably knows everything!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_602":"And the girl?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_603":"Let's grab her too, we'll figure it out later.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_604":"This was a grand victory! Almost as grand as me!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_605":"What's that? A talking penguin? Is this heat stroke, or is this really happening?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_606":"Demons are crazy! The moment something goes wrong, they start burning everything up! Now it's as hot as Hell here. You might get more than a heat stroke.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_607":"Are you alright, young miss?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_608":"Mira, my name's Mira. And you, buddy?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_609":"Ahem... Do not forget your manners. My name is King Biscuit Hartmann von Würstenberg III, at your service! But you can just call me Biscuit. What brings you to our lands?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_61":"It's not like I needed to say that, though...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_610":"I've been tasked by the Valkyrie Sisters to cross the Valley of Eternal Snow. But if this is the Valley, where's the snow?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_611":"No time to explain. The Valley is dangerous. Hordes of demons everywhere. I know a direct passage, I can show you the way. Just follow my tracks exactly.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_612":"Er... Your Majesty Frosty King, what got the demons so agitated? What are they even doing here?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_613":"I don't know, but they're quite the nuisance. They keep searching around, burned everything down already. It won't take long before they reach the hidden treasury.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_614":"Hidden treasury?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_615":"Oh, a special royal treasury. We need to get there before the demons do - good thing it's on the way.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_616":"Sounds like an adventure. We should hurry!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_617":"I can't figure out how to open it...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_618":"Have you tried \"Open Sesame\" yet?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_619":"Careful, you'll break it!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_62":"Should we keep it?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_620":"I hope the Cold Fire is inside...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_621":"I did not expect the mysterious treasury to be a stash of regular ice cream.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_622":"Not just any ice cream! The royal dessert!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_623":"Was it really worth it to risk our lives for sweets?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_624":"Indisputably!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_625":"*wro-o-oa-a-argh* (noise from the penguin's belly)","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_626":"What's that terrible growling?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_627":"I can't go on any further. I need to eat.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_628":"Again?!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_629":"The King needs to gather strength. The King is tired.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_63":"Dibs on destroying them!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_630":"We're making frequent stops. That makes us easy prey.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_631":"Let me just eat and I'll trash... I mean, I'll show these upstarts who's king!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_632":"Hey, hotheads! Where's your boss?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_633":"Whe-e-ere is the Cold Fire?!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_634":"At least tell us what it looks like!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_635":"You're stubborn for such a small... Er, bird?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_636":"I've got a steel will and my father's strong beak.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_637":"And the bright legs and red cheeks you get from your mum, I presume?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_638":"Stop with this cutesy stuff! The King isn't adorable, the King is imposing!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_639":"There's a bridge up ahead. Could be even more dangerous.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_64":"We need to escape this infernal mess, but I don't know where to go.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_640":"I'm here to kick demon butt and eat ice cream. And I'm all out of ice cream.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_641":"Mira, have you noticed? All the demons we've encountered said something about the Cold Fire.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_642":"Yes, I remember something like this. Aunt Helga, the senior Valkyrie, told me a fairy tale in my childhood - about the Cold Fire, which upholds the balance in nature...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_643":"Bwahaha! Who said it's a fairy tale?! I'll take it - and everything else I desire!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_644":"Where is it?! Tell me!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_645":"I don't have time to play with you!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_646":"It's so cold here!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_647":"You're just buying time!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_648":"Master, we don't have any troops remaining. They've all been captured. I'll be captured any moment myself.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_649":"Your orders?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_65":"Let's go! We might reach them just in time!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_650":"Retreat. We'll find another way to get back at the mortals.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_651":"Looks like nobody even knows what the Cold Fire looks like.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_652":"The King knows everything, young lady! Before you stands the one who uses the Cold Fire every day. Makes for some great desserts! Do you want some sorbet?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_653":"You're making ice cream with a relic? Can we use it to return the Eternal Snow to the Valley?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_654":"Not sorbet? How about some vanilla instead? And yes, we can use the Cold Fire for that.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_655":"If we can use the relic to calm down the upheaved elements, the initial balance should be restored.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_656":"And here are the forces of nature. Good boy, good boy! Here, a snowball! Catch!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_657":"Gr-r-r-r!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_658":"I thought we could just pet the creatures and they'd calm down. Why are they so aggressive?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_659":"It's too hot, they're melting, and that's making them suffer.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_66":"Anyway, I'll go ahead and do it!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_660":"We have to put a stop to that.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_661":"There are almost no icy feathers left. I ca-a-an't even bre-e-eathe.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_662":"The icy bird can barely flap its wings. Such a terrible sight. Hey, birdie, come down to us, we have ice cream!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_663":"No, wait! Well, now it's heading down to us, and it doesn't seem like it wants to play.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_664":"Do I gather correctly that the main danger of these creatures is that they can heal during battle?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_665":"You're a fast learner! I'll try to interrupt their healing.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_666":"Wow! Can you only do that to icy creatures?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_667":"You mean interrupt their healing?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_668":"Yes, you have a talent for it.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_669":"Never tried. I bet it'll work on anyone.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_67":"That means it's high time we examined every nook and cranny here.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_670":"Mira, we've almost reached a safe spot. That's where our paths will split.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_671":"King Biscuit offers you another adventure. I won't promise you'll kick some demons around, but it'll still be fun.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_672":"*the ground shakes, steam rises from the ground;\n what was once an Ice Elemental is now boiling hot*","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_673":"No time to think.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_674":"Will you fight the primordial forces?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_675":"Let's put the big guy to rest, and everything'll be fine.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_676":"I'M ME-E-ELTI-I-ING, O-O-OH","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_677":"Did you see that? Did you see me go?!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_678":"You were brilliant! Ice shards just flew left and right. Such power!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_679":"Can you feel it? The cold is finally back. It worked! It really worked! The Valley is safe.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_68":"Darkness was bad. Sun makes Mojo happy! Zaar bro-Khar!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_680":"Biscuit, listen. It's getting cold again, and I need to hurry. If you want, you can join me in my travels. I'm heading for the Sanctuary. It's a special place.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_681":"We'll be able to train our skills and find new friends there, just as gifted in magic as you are. What say you?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_682":"Sounds like an adventure. How much ice cream can we bring? The King needs a royal diet during travels.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_683":"As much as you want!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_684":"The road was long and hard, but I'm prepared to endure any hardships. After all these weeks, I stand at last before the Temple of Celestial Wisdom.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_685":"The dwelling halls of the Valkyries who bestow their blessing on the courageous, and the warriors of the Light!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_686":"As well as Demon Hunters, such as myself. It's high time I proved my efforts deserve the blessing!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_687":"Are my eyes deceiving me? A horde of enraged monsters is the last thing I expected to see at the gates of the sacred temple!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_688":"Thank you, traveler. The lesser minions of the Dark have been skulking around the outskirts of the temple lately. Something must be attracting them...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_689":"O celestial maiden, I swore to keep destroying demons until the day I die!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_69":"We need to go. Take care of what lies before us!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_690":"Might I receive the Valkyries' Blessing? It would give me the strength to proceed with my sacred mission!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_691":"What a fine oath, hero! I'll let you into the Temple and grant you the Blessing if you do me a favor.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_692":"The locals from a nearby village are complaining about their elder. He's either blind with love, or completely mad.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_693":"Find out what happened to him, and you shall receive what you yearn for.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_694":"I must... I must receive the blessing. The Valkyries will witness my zeal and acknowledge my sacred oath!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_695":"What are you muttering about, buddy? Still dazzled about those Valkyries, are you? I totally dig it. Those are some lovely ladies!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_696":"How dare you be so disrespectful! I won't tolerate...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_697":"There's no need for drama! I'm after their blessing too. Just like you, they sent me for some village elder.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_698":"Why don't we team up? I'm pretty fun to have around! I'm Galahad, by the way.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_699":"Not so fast! The mistress doesn't like pilgrims and vagabonds such as yourself loitering about!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_7":"The Archdemon's cronies want to avenge his defeat.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_70":"And yet, it's no good rejoicing so early. Mojo hasn't caught them all.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_700":"I'll bring her your severed heads myself. Oh yes! She'll be ever so pleased!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_701":"It's a trial of our strength and resilience. That's all there is to it.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_702":"It's time to feed your vile souls to my Reliquary, you abominations!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_703":"Hah! Let's slash and burn, my friend!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_704":"The road is clear. No longer will those foul creatures trample it!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_705":"By the way, I never introduced myself. I'm Tristan.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_706":"Tell you what, Tristan, you're not half bad!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_707":"Thank you, partner.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_708":"Now that the Reliquary has had a taste of demons, it'll be easier for me to sense them approach.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_709":"Where did you get your hands on this contraption? I could use one of these, too.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_71":"As for now, we need to hurry. I received a message that a Guardian went missing.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_710":"The demons would be in for such a beating!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_711":"Maybe later!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_712":"We shouldn't digress from our main goal. We have to reach the village by dusk. Let's go!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_713":"Here's the village. This place seems homey enough.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_714":"Yeah, no. Traversing the middle of nowhere after Strongford's broad avenues? No thanks! So, where's that elder of yours?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_715":"Did someone ask for the elder? That's me!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_716":"Look who's here, my beautiful goddess!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_717":"I swear upon my love to you, these are stray lambs like the ones who came before!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_718":"Greetings, elder! We bring help from the Temple...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_719":"Oh yes! I know what brings you here.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_72":"Winterfest Eve. Strongford, the Spruce and Cone inn.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_720":"So you wish to help unite two hearts destined to be together? How very praiseworthy of you!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_721":"Why, that's the kind of stuff I like. What do we need to do, old man?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_722":"Oh, barely anything at all!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_723":"You'll sacrifice yourself, so that my charming winged goddess can love me in return! And that's what true love is!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_724":"Sacrifice ourselves? No way! You've gone mad, old man!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_725":"Why would you refuse to lend me a hand with my heart's desire? Apparently, I have no choice but to be a bit more insistent!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_726":"Hey Pastry, bring these two to me!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_727":"Oh no! What did you do to Pastry?! He was such a good boy!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_728":"A gift from my beloved!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_729":"You've gone completely bonkers, old man! I'll take your head for this! Let me just...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_73":"It was Isaac's first visit here. Trying to blend in, the engineer headed straight to the inn.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_730":"Wait, Galahad. I want to understand what this poor sod is trying to say.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_731":"What?! The \"poor sod\" was about to kill us both!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_732":"Please be quiet. Wise elder, I'm sorry Pastry had to die, but we didn't come here in pursuit of death.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_733":"We're here on an errand from the Valkyries. We must complete their quest to receive their Blessing at the Temple.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_734":"That will never happen! Those who can't appreciate love and beauty aren't worthy of the Blessing!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_735":"I swear I'll capture you myself, just like I did with the last two fools who sought the Valkyries' Blessing!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_736":"And then I'll sacrifice you, just as my beautiful love wanted! When I do, she and I will be together forever!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_737":"Doesn't look like we get to choose here. It's time to let our weapons do the talking!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_738":"Hold your horses, old man. All is not yet lost!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_739":"Come, villagers! Get these scumbags!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_74":"What an awesome place! I'm kinda glad the Strongford engineers invited me here.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_740":"I never thought I'd be stupid enough to get trapped like that! Thank you, Tristan. Thank you, Galahad.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_741":"So the Valkyries sent you here as well, huh? Now I wonder...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_742":"Unlike us, Markus, these two kept their wits about them and saved our lives, in addition to their own.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_743":"Right now isn't the time for conversation, friends. We have to figure out what's going on.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_744":"Ouch! Eeek!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_745":"What do you think you're doing, you old fart?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_746":"Alas, there's no relying on lowly servants.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_747":"My winged love, forgive me! I've let you down...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_748":"You didn't live up to our expectations, naive fool. Die!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_749":"We'll have to take care of you personally, you pathetic upstarts!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_75":"Just how long is this going to last?! Winterfest is about to begin, and the lights are off! The city's as dark as a cave!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_750":"Righteous blood... It will open the Holy Gates for the Master!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_751":"My Reliquary is white-hot. Something's wrong...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_752":"The Valkyries have been swayed by dark magic!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_753":"Can I count on your help, my friends?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_754":"Sure thing, buddy!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_755":"The Light demands that we intervene!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_756":"Let's cleanse the Valkyries of this demonic influence!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_757":"Thank you for lifting the magic bindings the Archdemon put on us!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_758":"Is the Archdemon himself pulling the strings?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_759":"Yes. Hurry, for he's trying to breach the sacred Temple.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_76":"No need to worry, granny! Winterfest isn't even that important, duh.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_760":"If he corrupts the Hallowed Altar, our power will die away.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_761":"The magic artifacts, including your Reliquary, will fade alongside it.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_762":"In a world with nothing to restrain the demons, the rule of their hegemony will be but a matter of time.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_763":"We can't let that happen! Let us hurry, friends!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_764":"Here's the Temple Gate. But where's...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_765":"Why, you're just in time, Guardians!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_766":"I was just about to resort to brute force to break the door down. It's exhausting, I tell you!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_767":"Your blood, however, is imbued with the power of the Light, which can help me unseal the Gate.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_768":"Once I destroy the Sacred Altar, the world will no longer have the magic of the Light, which means it will freely succumb to me!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_769":"We won't let that happen!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_77":"But what about the holiday spirit, sonny? Where's the magic of winter?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_770":"The only way you can enter the temple is over our dead bodies, demon.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_771":"That's exactly what I plan to do!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_772":"You might have won this battle, Guardians, but I still have a few surprises in store for you!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_773":"You've taken my newly converted servants, the Valkyries!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_774":"Why don't I replace them with one of your party? How about you, swordsman?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_775":"Arrggh...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_776":"Hah! I like you better this way!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_777":"Now, crush your friends while I sit back and enjoy the show!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_778":"Galahad! What did he do to you?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_779":"Fight it!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_78":"That's not magic, granny. That's called e-lec-tricity. Think you can remember that? Here, let me light those lanterns.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_780":"I... I can't...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_781":"My Reliquary will purge the demonic magic from you!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_782":"Master... I'll destroy... them...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_783":"I can help Galahad, but the bond of the dark magic must be weakened first. Go for it, friends!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_784":"The dark will succumb!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_785":"Let's do it!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_786":"The temple is saved. We're all saved! You did it, Guardians!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_787":"I thought I was stuck like that for good!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_788":"I'd hate to serve the Archdemon. Not a big fan of the climate where he lives, see?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_789":"The Valkyries are indebted to you, as is the Dominion.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_79":"Let me see... Tighten a screw here... A bit of isolation there... Here goes!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_790":"For your valiant deeds, we grant our Blessing to you! From now on, you're Blessed!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_791":"Thank you for this great honor, celestial maidens! We swear to wield this power for the Light alone!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_792":"No demon shall evade the punishment they deserve!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_793":"My friends! I found a treasure map in the library yesterday.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_794":"Let me take a look. Hmm, it's authentic! We need to head out right away!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_795":"We'll have to fit our ships first. Let's split up and ask the Treasure Hunters for assistance.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_796":"Why do we stand still? The treasures of the Pirates await!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_797":"Interesting, what treasures of the Cutthroats does this island conceal?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_798":"A whole mountain of Corsairs' treasures is buried here! All we need is to find it.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_799":"Join the Hunt to access the treasures","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_8":"Hush! Listen... Is it just me, or is someone meowing out there?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_80":"Ooh, the city is shining bright, sonny! That's some amazing magic you've got there!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_800":"Join the Hunt to access the treasures","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_801":"Join the Hunt to access the treasures","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_802":"We'll find this treasure as soon as %param1% more Hunters join us.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_803":"We'll find this treasure as soon as %param1% more Hunters join us.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_804":"We'll find this treasure as soon as %param1% more Hunters join us.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_805":"Click on the chests to get the Pirates' treasures!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_806":"Click on the chests to get the Cutthroats' treasures!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_807":"Click on the chests to get the Corsairs' treasures!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_808":"Thank you! %param1% will help us find even more treasures.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_809":"Thank you! %param1% can already claim the treasure.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_81":"Ugh, haven't I told you already? It's called electricity, granny! E-LEC-TRICITY!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_810":"%param1% grants you access to the treasures of the Corsairs as a gift. Click on the chest to get your reward!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_811":"Winterfest Eve. Strongford, The Spruce and Cone Inn.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_812":"Once upon a time, the Evil Demon trapped the Daughter of Freedom in a magic book. While in that book, she was fed, cared for and treated with the utmost respect.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_813":"The maiden spent years and years in confinement, losing count of time. One day, the demon came to visit and asked:","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_814":"Are you doing well, my daughter? What doth your heart desire?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_815":"And the Daughter of Freedom replied:","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_816":"There's nothing I want, save for one thing: let me return to my world and be free once more!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_817":"Twang!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_818":"When my stockings came up empty,","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_819":"All my dreams were laid to rest.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_82":"E-lec-tricity or not, I'm ever so grateful! Here's your Winterfest gift!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_820":"Who destroyed the festive spirit","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_821":"To bring down Winterfest?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_822":"The Archdemon ruined it all when","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_823":"The holidays were to begin.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_824":"Shut your doors and shut your windows,","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_825":"Do not let the evil in.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_826":"Hey there, babyface! Aren't you gonna share your candy with the grownups? Come on, now - give it all to us!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_827":"No way! It's mine! Begone, demons!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_828":"Now wait just a minute... That won't do. This isn't a soap opera. Why steal candy from kids?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_829":"We're not some lowly bullies, you know. We're TRUE DEMONS!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_83":"I'm bored... The engineers haven't shown up. Perhaps it's time for me to leave...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_830":"And so we need to pull off something TRULY SAVAGE! Mwahahaha!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_831":"Truly savage? Like, steal-the-Festive-Tree savage?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_832":"And the gifts, too!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_833":"Now that, I like! Why don't we swap the gifts and ruin the entire holiday?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_834":"But we can still grab that tree, right?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_835":"Grab anything you want! We're about to surprise the Dominion with a TRUE WINTERFEST NIGHTMARE!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_836":"Hey, is there anyone on the other side of the screen?! Do something before those pesky bandits cause more trouble!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_837":"We were supposed to have a costume party here...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_838":"Look at Chabba! I have an idea. We can bring back the festive spirit without cutting down any trees.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_839":"What an outfit! Looking good, buddy. You look just like... well, a real festive tree.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_84":"Psst, boy. You must be new here.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_840":"Thank you, friend! It makes for a good disguise while I lie in the bushes and wait for prey. Put on some baubles, though, and it's a whole different story.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_841":"Is there anything to eat here?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_842":"Gingerbread and milk in the house, if you stand over there for a while.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_843":"I love gingerbread!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_844":"A living, environmentally friendly, festive tree. Why not?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_845":"Psst! You! The human on the other side! I've been spying on the demons. Let's hear their plan!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_846":"Don't just stand there! Get to work!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_847":"What are we going to swap those gifts for, Master? Are we going to give them gifts of our own?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_848":"There's nothing evil about that, is there?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_849":"Fools! You don't understand! We'll swap the good gifts for foul, filthy and dangerous things!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_85":"That I am. Are you a street performer? That's an interesting costume you've got there. The pet, too...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_850":"Let's put some rotten eggs under the Festive Tree! And into the stockings, too... Heh heh...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_851":"No, no, and no! We'll swap the gifts for the junk from our cursed vault.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_852":"We'll send the dangerous junk via fiend mail! The fiends will deliver those relics faster than holiday elves.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_853":"Now that's what I like to hear! Dark Valkyrie, make the arrangements.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_854":"Send Glutton to put Pandora's Box under the main Festive Tree in the Kingdom of Graven.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_855":"Wrap it up nicely, so no one suspects foul play. The box must be opened at midnight sharp.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_856":"Cholera will deliver the Jade of Hope to the Outland. With it, warriors will rush headlong into boss fights, expecting victory where there can be none.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_857":"Slaughter will plant our most recent invention, the shiny new Hammer of Guaranteed Victory, in the armory of the Grand Arena.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_858":"With it, the enemy will always win.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_859":"Bitey will ravage the Sanctuary by delivering Umbra, the Book of Souls and Shadows.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_86":"This is Laura! Don't you dare talk about her like that, lest you wish to bathe in your own blood, mortal!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_860":"The dark force within it will deal a crushing blow by poisoning all pet eggs in their incubators.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_861":"Be careful not to drop it or lose it, like last time.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_862":"The bug trapped inside is a fierce little thing. If it breaks out before you reach Sanctuary, it'll make mincemeat out of our fiend.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_863":"That's a mighty brilliant plan, Master! We're off to complete your orders!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_864":"Demons can turn anything into a dangerous weapon, no matter how useful or good it is at first. This is really bad. Let's hurry up and get help.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_865":"Look, there's a gift here. Does anyone know who it's for?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_866":"The note says, \"Destination: Sanctuary.\"","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_867":"The Sanctuary? That's a long way from here. Try as we might, we can't get there in time for Winterfest. Looks like someone isn't getting their gift.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_868":"Something's moving inside. Something... alive, apparently.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_869":"A bomb? Insects? Food? What is it?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_87":"Phew... Actually, I'm here with good intentions. It's the holiday season, after all!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_870":"It's... um... a puppy. He's a bit on the toothy side, though.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_871":"Grrrr! Arf! Arf!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_872":"Ooh, there's a good boy! No, no, don't eat me! You want a cookie?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_873":"Look, there's also a book here. A manual, perhaps. It's in Latin, though, so I can't read it.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_874":"Let me try. A-sha-pa-ka! Bi-te-us!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_875":"Huh? What?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_876":"Woof woof!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_877":"She appeared from the book, and we have no idea where the book came from.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_878":"Was it all in the package? Including him?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_879":"Arf! Arf!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_88":"Look, I'm not interested.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_880":"The package was to be delivered to the Sanctuary, but ended up here somehow. Wrong address, I guess. Something was moving inside, so we had no choice but to open it.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_881":"Stealing mail is a crime. Introduce yourself, miss.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_882":"My name's Iris. Some evil bastard locked me up in this book, and I was trapped there until today.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_883":"Unlawful confinement is a serious crime. Do you remember any details about the situation? What happened before and after?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_884":"Before my confinement, I used to teach young sorcerers and study dark magic in my spare time. I'm a licensed practitioner, mind.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_885":"Umbra, the Book of Souls and Shadows, was the most recent sorcery guide in my collection. Some fool from the gang of hell tried to steal it, so we got into a fight.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_886":"I cast a soul entrapment spell, but the cunning demon reflected it back at me. That's how I ended up trapped in the book.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_887":"While waiting for you, I've been practicing sorcery and mastering the spells from inside the book, trapped as I was in its pages.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_888":"What took you so long? Were you searching for me for a fortnight? A month?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_889":"I'm here to investigate a different matter: the suspicious package. Sorry, Miss Iris, but we haven't been searching for you at all.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_89":"There's a magic secret about Winterfest, and I'll help you discover it. Listen...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_890":"I'm opening a case file on your kidnapping. Do you have any possible suspects?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_891":"Suspects?! It was the Archdemon, that fiendish creature, I know that for a fact! Let me just find him, and I'll have my way with him!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_892":"The Archdemon? Your words lead me to believe that more than a month has passed, and who knows how much more. I'm afraid the Archdemon can't be defeated without proper preparations.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_893":"Calculating the operation... We're going to need one more hero. Requesting backup.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_894":"I'm going to rush straight into battle alongside all these new people...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_895":"Get down! With one swift, elegant movement, I'll teleport the tree back to where it belongs. It's no big deal, but I'd rather you not get in the way.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_896":"Hold on, shouldn't we... Oh, nevermind.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_897":"Think we should leave both trees here?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_898":"I could engineer an exoskeleton of sorts for Chabba's costume so he can stand here for a long time. It would make for a nice tradition.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_899":"We already have a nice tradition of our own. Someone tries to ruin Winterfest, then the entire year goes out of whack.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_9":"This kitty isn't as simple as it looks. It showed us the enemy's next outpost and helped find the exit from the ravaged city.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_90":"You shall find the first part within firelight. For the second, observe fireworks at night.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_900":"Statistics indicate that the last year was filled with events, discoveries, and inventions.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_901":"We crafted, experimented, researched and analyzed. Not a second passed in vain!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_902":"Let's unleash the power of sorcery and thrash those evildoers!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_903":"People of the Dominion! I'd like to start with the most urgent news.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_904":"The Archdemon and his minions have been stripped of their cursed relics.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_905":"The stolen gifts have been located and retrieved.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_906":"They are now being distributed by the Dominion's secret festive service.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_907":"Veteran sorcerers and elves are helping to deliver the gifts in short order.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_908":"The people are no longer in danger! The streets are safe once more.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_909":"Enjoy your holiday!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_91":"Are you kidding me? Do you really think I'm gonna believe in your silly rhymes?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_910":"The heroes of the Dominion wish everyone a merry Winterfest!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_911":"We hope the new year brings you success and happiness!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_912":"Share all your joy with your loved ones.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_913":"May luck and prosperity be your constant companions for the whole new year!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_914":"This place stinks of demons...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_915":"There, there, lovely. You allergic to demons or something? Sit down, before you get dizzy.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_916":"I'm a demon hunter... and this is a demon of the fourth degree! It preys upon the souls of everything it bites - I'm going to banish this filth right here and now!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_917":"This creature is our evidence. It must not be destroyed, or banished, until we recreate the events that have transpired.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_918":"*nom*","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_919":"beep boop... casing damaged...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_92":"Seek in the forests distorted by spells, seek in the caves where snow still dwells.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_920":"Shush, Bitey. Mommy will take care of it.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_921":"Mr. Demon Hunter, you're trying to banish a demon that I have enslaved for educational purposes.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_922":"If you still intend to proceed, please check with the Scientific Committee of Magic and obtain a proper permit, or else there'll be hell to pay.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_923":"You and your permits... A threat is looming over the world! ... Fine! Whatever it takes, I'll get that permit and banish this spawn of evil!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_924":"Good luck, lovely. It's gonna be a lot of trouble.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_925":"Demons, huh... More of them around...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_926":"I'm planning ahead in case he comes back.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_927":"There's a name on the collar. \"Bitey,\" and nothing else. Well, that explains a lot. So, what am I to do with you, little fiend?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_928":"Woof!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_929":"So you're not leaving, you don't have an owner, and you're being hunted by a madman. Did I get all of that right?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_93":"Ugh, what do you want from me?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_930":"Woof... Grrrr...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_931":"Apologies. I saw your curious companion and I just couldn't resist. It's a remarkable specimen you've got there;\n a purebred fiend of the fourth degree.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_932":"I only just got him. Can you tell me what he is?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_933":"In a nutshell, he's a rare demonic creature. Biteys are full of energy, which they focus on sharpening their teeth.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_934":"They tend to be aggressive and unwilling to obey any masters, but yours is surprisingly calm and well-mannered.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_935":"Well-mannered? He snaps at everything he sees!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_936":"Has he devoured anyone's pet yet?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_937":"Not yet, no... I guess you and I have our work cut out for us, buddy.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_938":"Arf arf!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_939":"Is that your dog?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_94":"Remember these words and find the holiday treasure! Embrace the spirit of Winterfest!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_940":"My fiend, you mean. Yes, what is it?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_941":"Your fiend bit me all over! Not even my armor helped. Look what he's done to me!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_942":"It's an outrage! Return me to my body at once!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_943":"Your fiend needs the company of other demons. Madame Lilith is an expert in beast rehabilitation, perhaps that's where he should go.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_944":"That's some serious damage. Not many sorcerers would agree to help you.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_945":"Actually, I can integrate your soul back into your body myself. Maybe even fix you up.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_946":"Why don't we forget about this silly little conflict? I promise it won't happen again.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_947":"There's no need to fix me up or anything. Just put everything back like it was.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_948":"I never thought these powers could be used for a good cause.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_949":"I should conduct some research into healing damaged souls.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_95":"This definitely smells fishy. Am I going to wait here for all eternity?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_950":"What did I miss? Was there a crime?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_951":"No, it's alright. Happy holidays!","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_952":"What a fluffy little cloud! Those teeth, though! You're so nice and plump! Your owner sure knows how to feed you.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_953":"*clang clang*","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_954":"Careful, he bites. Aren't you scared of him?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_955":"I keep two of these lads at home. Little troublemakers, I tell you! Tore apart my neighbor's scarecrow the other week! That's their idea of fun, you see.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_956":"Yeah, I can imagine.","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_957":"Mind if I give him a treat?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_958":"Do you have any spare souls on you?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_959":"I do, in fact. Here you are, boy. D'you like it?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_96":"Now, who's this handsome young fellow? Mmm...","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_960":"*om nom nom*","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_961":"Did... did he just feed him a piece of someone's soul?","LIB_MINIGAME_STORY_962":"It can't be...

We can help, but can they hold their hatred?","LIB_MISSION_DESC_117":"No one knows whether the watchman at the old lighthouse is alive.

One must know where to store their trophies, to set off post-haste after new ones.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_125":"This pile-supported hut has seen a lot: salty jests, the gold of many galleons, and barrels of rum. The old house is always full of guests.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_126":"Pirates know these places inside out. Others get lost in these countless rocks and whirlpools.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_127":"This is where greedy sea dogs start their voyages, setting off to do dishonest, but profitable business.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_128":"The southern streams are especially strong: they can carry heavy ships as far as the equator!","LIB_MISSION_DESC_129":"The narrow strait connecting the sea to the land of corals is full of submerged stones and traps.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_13":"Satyr crushed the rich harvest with his hooves.

But what is that, moving, just there, huge and full of teeth?","LIB_MISSION_DESC_142":"Bloody rituals are common here.

Keep looking ahead unless you want to follow them!","LIB_MISSION_DESC_168":"Blue flame burns as hot as lava, searing skin with strange and agonizing marks.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_169":"A sacred place, now home to dark mages. This is where the captured scholar Cornelius was kept.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_17":"The defiled statue of the king is looking at his subjects with sadness. The age of centaurs is coming to an end.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_170":"An incredibly strong energy source.

And so, naturally, the enemy knows your every move.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_179":"Razor-sharp spears will effectively convey how happy the locals are to see you.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_18":"The only place to cross is blocked by a gang of bandits. The way must be cleared at all costs.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_180":"This poor thing was here long before the war with the Archdemon. Fighting for land and resources never gets old!","LIB_MISSION_DESC_181":"Smoke and ashes, noise and clatter are common in this mining town. Even the war hasn't changed it.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_182":"You squelch through the mud, every step harder than the last. But this place is too dangerous to stop here.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_183":"This place looks like it was made for an ambush. A twig cracked in the grove on the right. Or was it your imagination?","LIB_MISSION_DESC_184":"It's getting hot. Surely you'll soon see the famous valley of geysers.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_185":"Hot springs coming out from the tops of mossy hills, a true wonder! This smell, though...","LIB_MISSION_DESC_186":"The stench of brimstone is too obnoxious, making it hard to breathe.

But no: this is where the dark hordes feast!","LIB_MISSION_DESC_188":"The Wargs were smart not to fight the invaders. Instead, they made an agreement and share their catch.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_189":"Go, don't be afraid. The ice this bridge is made of is thousands of years old, it has outlived whole dynasties.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_19":"The waters of this river wipe away all memories. Perhaps it was used to turn the forest dwellers to the dark side?","LIB_MISSION_DESC_190":"The realm of ice ends here. But will you get through Shavarakk's domain alive?","LIB_MISSION_DESC_191":"This is what remains of ancient glory, turned to ruins in the first war with the Darkness. Where are the drommers? What happened to their fascinating inventions?","LIB_MISSION_DESC_192":"Was it a good, or evil genius who gave rise to these surprisingly odd creatures? If it wasn't the drommers who made them this way, who could it be?","LIB_MISSION_DESC_193":"This land has been devastated by an odd epidemic. Some were deprived of their minds, while others turned evil and lost their souls. There's no joy beyond these windows, no life...","LIB_MISSION_DESC_194":"Despite the noise, this is where the best ideas of the drommer engineers were born. There's nobody left to reminisce about the good old days, though.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_195":"This place is renowned for the festival arranged by the king before the restored Titan Valley was launched! I can't hear any applause. Hello there? Has everyone gone extinct or something?","LIB_MISSION_DESC_196":"Numerous issues were discussed, lawsuits were settled, and debates flared up under the soaring chambers of these halls. Everyone is their own judge now, and evil is relative.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_197":"This is where books, diagrams, and newspapers used to be printed, contracts used to be drawn up, and the population census used to be conducted. Now the printing office is a shelter for these odd creatures.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_198":"It was here that the princess, the daughter of King Khornak, gave her passionate speech before the esteemed spectators. The last speech before she disappeared.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_199":"Look above, you'll see that the city hidden in the mountain has lost the roof over its head. The Titan Valley rose into the air, depriving the city of the last shreds of hope.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_2":"Even seasoned warriors stay clear of this place. The quietness is deceptive;\n just take a careful look!","LIB_MISSION_DESC_20":"The light can't pass through these thick branches. The shaman's dark magic made the shadows thicker, and now the darkness under trees is pitch-black.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_200":"These stairs have seen their share: the procession of Khornak, our great king;\n\n\n the progression of science, and engineering genius. Now you'll see only frenzied fanatics led on by their bloodthirsty instincts.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_201":"Even the metal stairs are melting in the unbearable heat emanating from the overheated Reactor's casing. Why can't it just destroy the evil creatures roaming around?","LIB_MISSION_DESC_202":"The further the dead districts of Ghirwil City are, the closer the culmination of this dreadful drama is. Can you feel the adrenaline rushing through your veins?","LIB_MISSION_DESC_203":"The reactor provided the city and its residents with a comfortable life. yet, it can also spell doom for all of creation. The world has been given to a madman as a sacrifice, and is now approaching an inevitable calamity at the speed of a blazing asteroid.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_204":"The only way to stop the reactor from overheating and exploding is to completely fill the compartment with coolant. Hurry up, before the temperature reaches the point of no return!","LIB_MISSION_DESC_205":"The mist covering the Dromm Plateau, like spilled milk poured across a table, hides dangers looming it its haze. If you haven't yet gone mad, stranger, beware of the bloodthirsty fanatics!","LIB_MISSION_DESC_206":"The Drommers are well aware that much like humanity, they descended from the Forerunners, following the path of knowledge fiercely. And yet the creators seem to have left their children to struggle with their fate for now.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_207":"Far away from their homeland, the drommers tried their best to uncover the secrets of creation. It was here, in Ghirwil City, that their thirst for knowledge backfired on them.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_208":"It's believed that the elemental currents that unite the planet's powers point at the spot where the Order of Creation built the Evolution Forge, from which life is born. But that's just a legend for now...","LIB_MISSION_DESC_209":"The items created by the artifact masters are true perfection, as the elemental currents are merged together in the process. The magic of the abode will be lost forever with the decline of the drommers, the great inventors!","LIB_MISSION_DESC_21":"Marax himself touched these lands with his fiery hand, giving birth to many terrifying creatures.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_210":"The lost harmony of this magnificent bridge is a bitter memento of the past achievements of the drommer folk. This object of former glory has been broken apart by vandals.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_211":"The entire bridge is permeated with threads of power. If the current is deprived of a single element, everything will go tumbling down into the abyss at once!","LIB_MISSION_DESC_212":"Each inch of this bridge is pierced with Master Tellm's gloomy musings about what else he had to achieve to ask for the princess' hand. This is where he experienced desperation, and this is where he found hope.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_213":"Don't be fooled by the enchanting view of the bridge, for it leads into the deeper halls. Nobody knows what goes on down there now!","LIB_MISSION_DESC_214":"The mountains, ravaged by mine tunnels, growled under the drommer advance. Nature and the thirst for progress collided, turning the entire process into a self-destructing mixture.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_215":"It's dangerous to follow the path to the darkness of the dungeons, home to the bandits who must be roaming free after the catastrophe in Ghirwil City.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_216":"This is where the fanatics led by their lord's will gather to perform their dark liturgy. Who will you become? A bystander, a victim, or the one ruling over the celebration?","LIB_MISSION_DESC_217":"Voices whisper, you may not proceed, you must turn back, forget this path forever... And still, what kind of bravery would it take to step forward and gaze straight into the dark face of danger?","LIB_MISSION_DESC_218":"A monster, a curse on his race, a dark stain in the canvas of history... He has a multitude of names! A substance full of spite and hatred, that has forgotten whom it used to be.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_219":"Defeat your enemies in battle with several waves of increasing difficulty.

You will receive a reward for each enemy defeated.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_223":"W15 M2 DESC __P6","LIB_MISSION_DESC_23":"Don't let the dry soil and decaying stumps deceive you: great evil resides in this place, and it seeks new victims.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_24":"The evil spirits that dwell here were marked by a powerful mage. It's sad that such talents serve demons.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_25":"The lava fracture leads to the planet's core, supplying the enemy legions with endless energy.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_26":"The orcish outpost emanates a horrific stench. These guys know nothing of cleanliness.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_27":"The dry bones of those who lost have been turned to dust under orcish feet. Many a squad came through here.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_28":"This huge stone stairway is a great place for an ambush. Better move along the stairs quickly.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_29":"Unending groups of guards move around. The outpost's soldiers wouldn't miss a chance to rob a careless traveler.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_3":"A gang of monsters is rampaging in the forest without mercy. Be careful, heroes, don't get caught in their fiery trap!","LIB_MISSION_DESC_30":"The foulest and most cowardly monsters dwell here. Their prey is weak and wounded warriors.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_31":"Do you feel somebody watching? Look carefully into the darkness of the caves. The glittering of hundreds of eyes will be your answer!","LIB_MISSION_DESC_32":"Oh, no! The enemies want to destroy the bridge over the River of Oblivion! This can't be allowed!","LIB_MISSION_DESC_33":"Look, a squad of orcs is carrying heavy bags full of stolen goods. They should be returned to their owners.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_34":"The forest around the funeral path to the sanctuary is filled with marauders.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_35":"If there's anything sacred for orcs, it's the sanctuary of the ancestors. And killing an outsider is a great way to make the forefathers happy!","LIB_MISSION_DESC_36":"The pine woods groan under the pressures of dark magic. We must remove this corruption at all costs!","LIB_MISSION_DESC_37":"These roads have been unusable ever since evil settled into the clearing.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_38":"Removing orc patrols from the path will open up the roads for trade caravans. But for how long?","LIB_MISSION_DESC_39":"Elite squads rest here before starting new, violent, and devastating marches.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_4":"A strange place where many people disappeared. Time to find those responsible and deal with them!","LIB_MISSION_DESC_40":"Gro Bulgor is a vicious leader who pities neither his allies, nor his enemies. Do you still wish to proceed, heroes?","LIB_MISSION_DESC_41":"If you notice a cute sheep on a pasture, remember: there's a wolf under this clothing.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_42":"Clearings with lush grass are replaced by lifeless desert, stretching for miles in every direction.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_43":"You're approaching the territory of cold and despair. There's nobody alive here, but nobody dead either.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_44":"The road to Gravehall holds many dangers. Will the detour help to avoid them?","LIB_MISSION_DESC_45":"Many gangs of highwaymen block the path to the main destination. But defeating them will be easy!","LIB_MISSION_DESC_46":"You should cross this part of the way as soon as possible to avoid the stony traps of the mountain ravine.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_47":"Be careful when breathing the local air. The power of hatred that fills it is more dangerous than smoke.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_48":"It seems that Hell itself opened its gates into this land. How many monsters will it spawn?","LIB_MISSION_DESC_49":"If you gaze long enough into an abyss, the abyss gazes back into you. Go forth with courage and don't let the evil consume you.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_5":"Wagons loaded with foreign goods are left unattended. Hurry to save their owners!","LIB_MISSION_DESC_50":"A place of silence and sorrow turned into a city of furious souls who couldn't find peace.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_51":"Throughout the ages the number of loyal servants remains the same. Their trapped souls will never tire of serving their master.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_52":"Tread as quietly as you can, otherwise you might wake the locals from their eternal sleep.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_53":"Morana's song echoes around Necropolis, drawing forsaken souls to fight the last battle.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_54":"An icy chill runs down your spine when you enter the Atrium. A feeling of looming danger clenches your heart.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_55":"The masters of the dead lands won't tolerate the living in their halls! The deadly reaping has begun!","LIB_MISSION_DESC_56":"Sadly, the terraces of pure onyx now belong to the enemy.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_57":"Two sisters, Selena and Morana, hold the night's shroud. As long as the obelisk is in one piece, the lands are ruled by darkness.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_58":"Do you see the green flicker? Here, the world of the departed merges with living matter. This is how evil enters our lands.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_59":"You can see the light at the end of the halls of the dead. But that doesn't mean that danger is behind you.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_6":"This is the main road into the city. The bitter smell of smoke and cinder is a bad omen. Are you brave enough to enter?","LIB_MISSION_DESC_60":"After many days of darkness the bright sun is blinding. And it makes you an easy target!","LIB_MISSION_DESC_61":"A squad of watchful centaurs is preparing something bad on the way to Cadang Thicket.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_62":"Watch your step! Nature itself has taken the enemy's side!","LIB_MISSION_DESC_63":"Making your way through thick brush is not only exhausting, but also dangerous: it's a good place for an ambush.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_64":"The sixth sense tells experienced warriors that this beauty is deceiving. The riverbanks are crawling with monsters.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_65":"It was here where the mad Liros, rejected by the one he loved, drowned himself in the green waters of the river.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_66":"Cadang Thicket is a home to centaurs. Their wild temper makes these creatures very unpredictable.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_67":"The fires are burning, so this place isn't completely abandoned. Who's there? Hello!","LIB_MISSION_DESC_68":"Don't be deceived by the coziness of these delicate awnings and the warmth of the fires;\n\n the enemy is on their way.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_69":"The scent of the bright local trees dims the mind. Better leave this place as soon as possible.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_7":"Fire sparks are jumping along the rooftops, distracting you from the main danger ahead, at the end of the street. Be careful!","LIB_MISSION_DESC_70":"Creaking, noise, grumbling, crashing;\n it's Scrump, angry at the whole world. His stocky roots are ready to grab and hold till your last breath.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_71":"Swamp miasma is very troublesome for travellers, while the local evil creatures adore this aroma.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_72":"The bog is very useful to the local monsters. They simply wait until a careless traveller steps into this dangerous sludge.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_73":"It's the Bogger's lair. Pray to God the master is not home.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_74":"Wet soil keeps slurping under your feet. There isn't a living soul around. But lots of the dead!","LIB_MISSION_DESC_75":"The enchanting roots of this plant drive anyone who dares to taste them mad.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_76":"Thousands of people came to bury Lord Wreedlove, but couldn't lay him to rest forever. He was a good person;\n too bad he was also a vampire.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_77":"It's a cold and desolate place. Even the flames of torches and the glittering fireflies seem frightening and dangerous.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_78":"The road is covered with a fog so thick you can't see the end of your nose. Try not to fall off the precipice nearby.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_79":"Another step, and you'll enter the domain of Morth Chrone. The Reaper of Souls and his accomplices would love a fresh meal...","LIB_MISSION_DESC_8":"The evil demons long for revenge. Their feet are pounding on the paved road, echoing terribly among stone walls.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_80":"Some people succumbed to the influence of the dark and started serving it of their own accord, losing their minds and freedom forever.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_81":"There's only one path leading to the halls of Morth Chrone. His servants will do everything to prevent you from entering!","LIB_MISSION_DESC_82":"Vile creatures multiplied in the darkness of the night, scaring travellers and taking their souls.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_83":"Who is hiding in the shadow? Whose eyes are glowing with otherworldly fire in the dark? Be prepared, heroes, death is at your heels!","LIB_MISSION_DESC_84":"The look of this territory, covered in spiderwebs, promises trouble. Slaves of the dark won't let outsiders reach their master.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_85":"A place where time stands still. The lair of the reaper of souls, who feasts on the misery of others. Stop Morth Chrone!","LIB_MISSION_DESC_86":"Be wary of the orcish camp ahead. You need to clear it step by step, without causing camp-wide alarm.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_87":"Orcish weapons look rough and crude but they last for years. You can seriously harm the enemy by clearing out their armory.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_88":"Break the fangs of the local monsters, punish their greediness.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_89":"Orcs light torches after every victory over the kingdom's soldiers. Aren't these monsters overconfident?","LIB_MISSION_DESC_9":"Tales flew about and ale flowed like a river in Gordon's house, until the monsters burnt it. Time to avenge the old man!","LIB_MISSION_DESC_90":"Here orcs and ogres perfect their skills. Show them what the true art of war looks like!","LIB_MISSION_DESC_91":"This is the Arena of the Chosen. Here the strongest gladiators fight to their death.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_92":"Robbers and highwaymen, those are the current dwellers of the sacred places. These people are no better than orcs.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_93":"This gang is especially dangerous. Imperial soldiers in the past, now turned rogues.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_94":"Decrepit bridges are the only connection between human and titan lands. When they finally break, whoever is crossing will be thrown into a bottomless chasm...","LIB_MISSION_DESC_95":"Titans and humans lived in peace until Seymour's wicked lie cast a shadow of mistrust over their friendship.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_96":"Everybody knows this was the site of the legendary battle between titans and humans.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_97":"The war separated the peoples. Nobody knew the world would be stricken by disaster: the titans are extinct and the humans are struggling for survival.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_98":"The brave warriors of Brand's Legion once took this road. Now vultures circle above it, and hungry ghouls wait for travellers.","LIB_MISSION_DESC_99":"The great warlord Brand fell in a battle against enemy hordes.

You should be, though.","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_139":"The abode is surrounded by the fanatics. I can see them. They're going somewhere down the path, into the depth.","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_14":"Servants of darkness, destroy the Guardians!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_140":"Hey, Ragni, our efforts didn't go to waste when we drommers were creating the Circle of Summoning and the Titan Spheres.","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_141":"Really?","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_142":"Of course! Just remember what happened before. The quarrel between the humans and the Titans, the first war with Darkness, and the disembodiment of the Titans in the Elemental Ether.","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_143":"I'm well aware of this story. What's your point?","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_144":"Ever since we figured out how to disembody Titans in the Circle of Summoning, the Titans and the humans learned to understand each other and forgot their bad blood.","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_145":"Stop talking nonsense! It can't have happened!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_146":"How else would I have brought the Guardians here alongside an entire Titan squad?","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_147":"I might believe you if you save me!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_148":"Ugh, listening to these crazy creatures mutter makes my skin crawl...","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_149":"Actually, Tellm started speaking just like that when we last met.","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_15":"The evil is near, stay alert!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_150":"Tellm? Isn't that one of your ''Invincible Four?''","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_151":"Yes, but he started avoiding us from that day on.","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_152":"The examination? Is that the day you mean, Master Ragni?","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_153":"Yes. Tellm was the only one who failed it. I believe he was furious with the entire world, not just us.","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_154":"The worst part is that Tellm claims I ''stole'' his element. Fire itself chose me, though!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_155":"Hey? Master Ragni, where are you?","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_156":"Whew, finally! I almost forgot what it's like to enjoy freedom! Dugg the Constructor, what happened to the city?","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_157":"I can't believe my eyes! Ghirwil City lost its roof! Something really terrible is going on here!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_158":"You leave a city unsupervised a little while, and this is what happens. No good...","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_159":"Seriously! Not now, alright? The bridge is non-functional. Look, the fanatics are trying to cross it, falling down into the abyss!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_16":"In the name of Archdemon!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_160":"What do we do now, Master?","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_161":"Well... The technology of the Rainbow Bridge is based on the titanic function of the three elements. The only element powering the bridge right now is Fire.","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_162":"These pillars are all that's left in the city from the Titan Valley. I'm sure we can find what we need there!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_163":"We have to collect Shards of Earth and Water to restore the balance.","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_164":"Well done! The bridge is functioning again!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_165":"Ragni... you still live? What a shame... Thanks for rebuilding the bridge, by the way.","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_166":"You couldn't have done anything dumber! Ha!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_167":"And you, Tellm, you look as though you're standing at death's door. What happened to you?","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_168":"What would you know about the sacrifices one can offer to science and progress!?","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_169":"You were just lucky to become a master, taking my element, MY ELEMENT!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_17":"I'll break your spine!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_170":"You're full of spite... Answer me, Tellm, do you have anything to do with what's going on in the city? With the king's madness?","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_171":"The king was naive. As for you, you have yet to recognize my genius, surpassing any other by a thousandfold!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_172":"Master Ragni, we have to overtake Tellm. He clearly has something to do with all this!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_173":"Overtake? You must be mad, Guardian Mimir! I've sacrificed too much for my discoveries.","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_174":"You've been having fun while I dedicated each passing moment of my life to science!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_175":"And so, I'm the one who deserves to make the discovery that will turn this world on its head!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_176":"I discovered an object of an unknown element, its power beyond anything known before!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_177":"Don't you dare touch the fanatics and madmen. I created them. They're mine!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_178":"Do you even realize what you've done, Tellm!?","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_179":"Silence! Every one of them will become an obsidian statue, a black soul stone for the Titan I need so much!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_18":"Use your ultimate ability!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_180":"You're late for the ritual. It has already begun! Now, behold my new form, my immense power!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_181":"Holy Forerunners! It... it just... killed Tellm! It tore him apart!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_182":"Bow before my might! I am reborn, brimming with power! Today marks the day that everyone remembers who Seymour is!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_183":"The ancient war between humans and Titans isn't over yet.","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_184":"Oh, the irony! How could the drommers, the smartest race on this planet, have made the dumbest mistake ever?","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_185":"Tellm... Poor Tellm... You were deceived. Your thirst for new discoveries was the death of you.","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_186":"This evil has to be put to an end!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_187":"What do we do, Ragni? Seymour is a dark Titan from the ancient past.","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_188":"His might is colossal, and his hatred knows no bounds.","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_189":"He was the one to drive a wedge between humans and Titans. He was later disembodied into the Elemental Ether, together with his entire race.","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_19":"Open magical chests to unlock new heroes and evolve your team!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_190":"Whoever he is, he's pure evil. And evil must be banished!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_191":"May the eternal light shine in the darkness!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_192":"The spawn of Darkness which caused the rift between the humans and the Titans was defeated by them so many years later!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_193":"Deliverance in death is too light a punishment for an evil so terrible.","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_194":"It grants eternal life in the blessed Elemental Ether, together with an opportunity for reincarnation.","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_195":"Endless contemplation in the bonds of the Light is fair retribution.","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_196":"You made it. Humans, drommers, and Titans.","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_197":"You proved ready to move on, past former grievances, and protect your home together.","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_198":"Farewell, Guardians of the Dominion. Your path in the land of the drommers has come to an end.","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_199":"An iron plate covered with symbols... What a curious finding!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_2":"The portal will get me right to the battlefield!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_20":"I'm also looking for Archdemon who is hiding somewhere in your lands.","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_200":"I can decipher these writings for you.","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_201":"This is a fragment of Ghirwil City's history.","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_202":"Collect the rest of the fragments, and then we might be able to find out the cause of what happened in the city.","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_203":"Oh no, this is the worst that could happen! Seymour is a dark Titan from the ancient past, who turned the entire world into a battlefield soaked with blood.","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_204":"His hatred knows no bounds, and his might keeps growing stronger with each new black soul stone.","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_205":"More and more fanatics are sacrificing themselves, which means the Titan will soon incarnate and free himself from the bonds of the ether.","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_206":"This will spell the end of all creation...","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_207":"Guardians! So happy to see you! This sense of impending doom is tearing me apart at the seams!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_208":"Mira, she's... She's waiting for you! You must head for the Valkyrie Sanctuary immediately.","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_209":"Come on, hurry! She needs you out there!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_21":"I'll help you find and defeat him!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_211":"Chaos is here! The Oracle was right. I knew trouble awaited us, but I didn't expect it so soon...","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_212":"The strongest Valkyries are too far away. And here I am, the youngest Valkyrie, stuck coming up with a solution in this dreadful situation!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_213":"Sanctuary is the final stronghold. If it is lost, we cannot win this. And I'm just an ordinary instructor!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_214":"Alright, I have an idea: I'll try to awaken the Tree of Life while you keep the enemy distracted! You won't be alone in this, I will grant you a helper.","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_215":"Hurry, Guardians! Choose one of my pets and cleanse all corruption from our Sanctuary to awaken the Tree!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_218":"There you go! Offer some nectar to your newfound friend. They'll become stronger yet to fight off the Chaos.","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_22":"I can feel dark energy. Here, quick!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_221":"Do not hesitate! Some food will let your companion feel better!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_222":"I will begin the ritual: you must protect Sanctuary meanwhile. Onward!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_225":"The corruption is getting too close. You must get rid of it before I can awaken the Tree's magic. Please, hurry!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_228":"The corruption has covered the entire Sanctuary. The Tree cannot fully unleash its powers while it is surrounded. Cleanse the corrupted areas!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_229":"Take a companion into your team. They have been created to fight Chaos and Dark!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_23":"Let's save our Guardians!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_230":"Gather a team of the best Guardians! Ours will be a dangerous deed, especially with all the strongest Valkyries far away from here.","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_231":"Don't worry about your companion! It's safe behind your lines, protected by the team.","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_232":"This is it, the moment of truth! The little one is ready to reveal its greatest skill!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_235":"It awakens! The Great Tree of Life has answered my call! Continue staving off the corruption, please. Help the miracle come true!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_236":"Something's wrong! The enemies are too strong, and your attacks aren't doing anything!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_237":"What do we do?!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_239":"Well I'll be... Their power is astounding!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_24":"It's not that easy, %param1%.","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_240":"I think it's because of that horrible looking eye. Its glare is making the enemies stronger!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_241":"Mira, you're right!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_243":"(The Valkyries join your group.)","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_244":"You've arrived at last!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_245":"We bring naught but bad news: the Dominion is besieged as Chaos corrupts the Guardians into fighting their kind.","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_246":"That tower over there is the Eye of the Herald. As it observes the enemy forces, it bestows incredible power and strength upon them.","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_248":"We shall destroy that tower!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_25":"Curse on them is stronger than was on me!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_253":"The accursed eye will trouble us no more. The path is open. Attack the enemy!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_256":"A most dangerous foe awaits. This monster is a fount of corruption.","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_257":"The ritual is ready. Just let the beast in closer, so that the magic of the Tree strikes it down. Attack!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_259":"It's coming at you, Guardians! Hold on!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_26":"His minions are everywhere.","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_260":"O Tree of Life, reveal thyself in all thine might! Redeem us!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_261":"FOR CHAOS!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_263":"Sanctuary is safe! But that was only the first step to defeat Chaos once and for all!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_264":"All corruption has been banished from Sanctuary by the light from the awakened Tree of Life.","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_267":"It was thanks to you that I completed the ritual in time. I thank you, Guardians!","LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_268":"You have received valuable trophies during the adventure.

A Squad Location contains enemies that you have to destroy to advance on the map, Tower Locations focus their beams on the Squads to buff them until they're destroyed.\n\nYou may attack the same enemy location several times to wear the enemy down, as enemy Health does not reset (enemy Energy does).\n\nOn higher difficulties, certain enemy locations will get permanent buffs. Keep that in mind as you move across the map!<\/p>\n\n<h2>Player Buff Points<\/h2>\n<p>Locations marked with big flowers contain buffs for your team that last for an entire Adventure. \n\nBuffs grant significant buffs to heroes, but each group member only gets to pick one, so remember to communicate with your team and discuss the choices.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Rewards and Victory Points<\/h2>\n<p>You earn Victory Points as you fight battles. When you earn enough Victory Points, you'll be able to unlock a reward chest, or a Boss Chest after prevailing over the Boss of this Adventure.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Teamwork<\/h2>\n<p>Remember, only your guildmates may join you on an Adventure, so treat your guildmates with respect and do not get anxious over any losses. Assist each other on the Adventure and use text and voice chat to discuss strategy as you go.<\/p>\n\n<h1>Completing the Adventure<\/h1>\n<p>You'll be able to complete the Adventure when all players in your team spend all their Action Points or defeat all enemies on the map. You must open all the chests you can before you can leave the Adventure.\n\nThere is also an option to leave the Adventure before it ends through the Log menu, but you will not be able to return to the same group if you do that.<\/p>\n<\/html>","UI_DIALOG_ADVENTURE_SOLO2_STORM_COIN_BUY":"Buy with a Special Offer","UI_DIALOG_ADVENTURE_SOLO_BATTLE_RESULT_ENEMY":"Enemy squad:","UI_DIALOG_ADVENTURE_SOLO_BATTLE_RESULT_LOSE":"Defeat","UI_DIALOG_ADVENTURE_SOLO_BATTLE_RESULT_WIN":"Location secured!","UI_DIALOG_ADVENTURE_SOLO_MAP_CHEST_TOOLTIP_TITLE":"Find the chest hidden within the Great Storm to open it and claim the reward.","UI_DIALOG_ADVENTURE_SOLO_MAP_NODE_DANGEROUSLY":"Caution!","UI_DIALOG_ADVENTURE_SOLO_MAP_NODE_DANGEROUSLY_TOOLTIP":"This location is too dangerous for now.","UI_DIALOG_ADVENTURE_SOLO_MAP_NODE_DANGEROUSLY_WARNING":"As you approach the center of the Great Storm, the damage dealt by the Force of the Storm increases! \n \n ^{255 255 255}^Increase your Storm Resistance^{\/color}^ by defeating enemies so your heroes can advance to the center.","UI_DIALOG_ADVENTURE_SOLO_MAP_NODE_DANGEROUSLY_WARNING_TITLE":"Be careful!","UI_DIALOG_ADVENTURE_SOLO_MAP_NODE_DESC":"The Harbinger's Stele buffs enemies in its area of effect.","UI_DIALOG_ADVENTURE_SOLO_MAP_NODE_STORM_EFFECT":"Storm Effect","UI_DIALOG_ADVENTURE_SOLO_MAP_NODE_STORM_EFFECT_DESC":"Your heroes lose %param1%% of their max health in pure damage once per second.

Top players and guilds will compete in cross-server rankings and may even make history by entering the Hall of Fame.<\/p>\n \n <h2>Two Phases<\/h2>\n <p>A guild raid lasts one week and consists of two phases.<\/p>\n \n <p>In Phase 1, you battle the boss's minions. This phase begins on Monday and ends on Thursday. Progress in minion battles is calculated differently for all players, but the difficulty is the same for all guild members.<\/p>\n \n <p>Phase 2 is unlocked on Friday, introducing the boss. Each guild member can participate in the boss fight and detract from the boss's shared health pool.<\/p>\n \n <h2>Minions<\/h2>\n <p>Minions are battle nodes on the boss map. Depending on the node, you will need to battle 1, 2, or 3 enemy teams.<\/p>\n \n <p>For battling minions, you receive Valor Emblems and increase your guild's Morale, a temporary score that is reset at the end of the week.<\/p>\n \n <p>Minion nodes are unlocked over the week, with 5 nodes being unlocked on Monday, 2 on Tuesday, etc.<\/p>\n \n <p>The number of attack attempts is the same as the number of minion nodes. The daily number of attempts you receive is equal to the number of nodes that are unlocked on that day.<\/p>\n \n <h2>Valor Emblems and Buff Shop<\/h2>\n <p>Emblems are a currency you can exchange for buffs in the raid's Buff Shop. Buffs boost you in battles with the minions and the boss. At the end of the week, all buffs are reset.<\/p>\n \n <p>The number of Emblems received and buff tiers available in the shop depend on the boss's level at the start of the week. Higher-level bosses unlock better buffs.<\/p>\n \n <p>The shop's assortment is subject to minor random changes over the weeks.<\/p>\n \n <p>Buffs obtained from the shop only affect the player who purchased them.<\/p>\n \n <h2>Guild Morale<\/h2>\n <p>Guild Morale is a damage boost that is only active in boss fights. Guild Morale affects all guild members.<\/p>\n \n <p>The Emblems earned by each guild members are counted towards the total Guild Morale. Higher Morale means that each guild member deals more damage to the boss.<\/p>\n\n <p>You can attack the boss starting on Friday, in-game time. You have only 5 attack attempts and each hero can only be used once a week.<\/p> \n <h2>Boss Level<\/h2>\n\n <p>Once the boss is defeated, they are revived at a higher level than the last. Each guild member can then claim a reward for the defeated boss's level. If the guild defeated a max level boss, they are revived at the same level instead.<\/p>\n \n<h2>Rewards<\/h2>\n <p>By participating in Guild Raid battles, you obtain resources for Hero Ascension. These resources can be earned by attacking minions and dealing damage to the boss, as well as guild victories against the boss.<\/p>\n\n<p>To receive a reward for defeating the boss as well as the Hall of Fame reward, you must deal damage to the current Guild Raid boss.<\/p>\n \n <h2>Weekly Cycle<\/h2>\n <p>The Guild Raid progress is reset at the end of the week. The Guildmaster, a General or an Officer can select the Guild Raid level for the next week before it begins. The highest level at which the guild defeated the boss will be selected by default. If the guild has not battled that boss yet, the lowest available level will be selected instead.<\/p>\n \n <p>The selected level also determines the levels of the boss's minions.<\/p>\n\n <h2>Guild Raid access after changing guilds<\/h2>\n <p>When you leave a guild and join a new one, the Guild Raid will be locked until the next raid week begins. If you rejoin the same guild, your progress won't be reset and you'll be able to keep attacking your opponents. <\/p>\n\n <p>To keep your rewards, leave the guild Friday to Sunday. If the player has dealt damage to the guild's current boss before leaving the guild, they'll receive the reward for defeating the boss as well as both personal and their former guild's Hall of Fame rewards at the end of the week.<\/p>\n\n <p>Once a guild member reaches Level 65, they immediately unlock the Guild Raid.<\/p>\n <\/html>","UI_DIALOG_CLAN_RAID_SCHEDULE_RULES_TEXT":"<html>\n<h1>Current Guild Raid difficulty<\/h1>\n<p>1.

The guild earns ranking points for each battle. The ranking determines the guild's league, which in turn determines the value of battle rewards and seasonal rewards.\r\n\r\n<\/p>\r\n<h1>Participants<\/h1>\r\n<p>Guilds from all servers are eligible for the Clash of Worlds as long as they are in the Guild War's Silver League or higher.\r\nIf a guild is demoted from the Guild War's Silver League, it can no longer participate in the Clash of Worlds battles until it returns to the Silver League. In the meantime, it receives a penalty of %param3% ranking points for each battle ignored, which is substracted from its current ranking score.\r\n\r\n<\/p>\r\n<h1>Seasons<\/h1>\r\n<p>A Clash of Worlds is divided into seasons, each lasting %param2% weeks. Results are calculated at the end of %param2% weeks. After that, seasonal rewards are awarded and season's top 50 guilds receive extra rewards.\r\nGuilds start the first season with a ranking score based on the total power of each guild member's top 15 heroes and top 10 titans.<\/p><p>After that, guilds start the season with a ranking score based on the guild's ranking in the previous Clash of Worlds season.\r\n\r\n<\/p>\r\n<h1>Battles<\/h1>\r\n<h2>Matchmaking<\/h2>\r\n<p>At the start of the first battle day, a guild is matched with an opponent adjacent in ranking. If the adjacent guild was its opponent within %param6% days, the guild is matched with the next adjacent guild instead.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Duration<\/h2>\r\n<p>During the Clash of Worlds, all battles last %param1% days each, Monday to Friday.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Defense<\/h2>\r\n<p>Each guild member assembles three hero defense teams and two titan defense teams.\r\nWhen planning fortification defense, the Guildmaster and Generals select 60 hero defense teams and 40 titan defense teams among all guild members.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Attacking<\/h2>\r\n<p>Attacking requires 1 team. The attacking team can differ from defense teams assigned to fortifications. It is assembled right before attacking an enemy fortification.\r\nEach guild member has a total of 5 attack attempts: 3 with heroes, and 2 with titans.\r\nEach hero and titan can be a part of an attacking team only once and cannot be selected until the next battle after attacking.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Fortifications<\/h2>\r\n<p>The fortification is captured when all defending teams are defeated. The guild earns extra capture points for fully capturing the fortification.\r\nSome fortifications have defense team buffs. Each fortification's buff level scales with the number of specific units assigned to defend it. The buff can be increased by assigning heroes with a specific role or titans of a specific element, stated in the fortification description.\r\n\r\n<\/p>\r\n<h1>Ranking<\/h1>\r\n<h2>Ranking score<\/h2>\r\n<p>The score earned in battles is determined by capture points. The ranking score is calculated by dividing the difference between the two guilds' capture points by 10.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Victory<\/h2>\r\n<p>The guild that scores more capture points than the opponent wins the battle and receives %param4% extra ranking points. <\/p>\r\n<h2>Draw<\/h2>\r\n<p>In case of a draw, both guilds receive %param5% points each. The ranking points are added on the last day of the battle, when the winner is determined.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Defeat<\/h2>\r\n<p>After a defeat, the difference in capture points divided by 10 is substracted from the guild's ranking score.\r\n\r\n<\/p>\r\n<h1>Leagues<\/h1>\r\n<p>There are %param7% leagues in the Clash of Worlds. Each guild's ranking score changes after each battle depending on its results. After meeting the score threshold, a guild automatically advances to the new division or league.\r\nIf a guild loses enough ranking points to drop below the league's threshold, it is demoted to a lower-tier division. If it was the league's lowest division, the guild is demoted to a lower-tier league.\r\nA guild cannot be knocked out of the Clash of Worlds because of low ranking.\r\n\r\n<\/p>\r\n<h1>Rewards<\/h1>\r\n<h2>Regular rewards<\/h2>\r\n<p>Battle rewards and end-of-season rewards scale with the guild's division and league.\r\nThe rewards for entering a league and battle rewards are sent out at the end of the participation day. The seasonal rewards are sent out at the end of the season.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Top Guilds<\/h2>\r\n<p>The top 50 guilds in the seasonal leaderboard receive an extra reward at the end of the season.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Players kicked from guild<\/h2>\r\n<p>After being kicked from the guild, a player receives the guild's end-of-season reward in the ratio of the player's battles in the guild to the guild's total battles. The battles where the player didn't have attack attempts don't count.\r\nIf a player joined another guild after being kicked, they receive the full reward for their current guild as well as their previous guild's reward.\r\n\r\n<\/p>\r\n<h1>Penalties<\/h1>\r\n<h2>For the player<\/h2>\r\n<p>If the player joins a new guild participating in the Clash of Worlds during a battle, they can't participate in their new guild's current battle.
